Cameron.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Then that's all you had to say.
What good stuff?
No.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
What?
Why?
You did what?
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
It's just you.
And where're you going?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Thirty-two.
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
No, I ' m not.
Yeah -- we'll see.
Don't make me do it, man
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
You just said
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
How much?
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
You -- covered in my vomit.

I'm fine. I'm
Sure, I do
You know what they say
I'm gettin' there
Unwelcome.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Look up, sunshine
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Fallacy.
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Is that right?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Enough!
Because you're making decisions for me.
Yeah...
What?
We're your guys.
Good enough.
Yeah.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
See you next week!
Tumescent!
But -- who -- what --?
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
I am, Your Eminence
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
No?
I'm not bargaining!
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief says...
You did the same to your God!
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
That's what it says.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
I knew you would.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
I was all of these.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
What else do you need?
Somewhere else?
Daphne, I...
Go on.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
End my career?
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
This isn't homicide school.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I'll call it... tails.
I'm on duty.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
You wanna talk to her alone?
My point exactly.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Hey.
Could be Leon's.
That's good.
I'm not moody.
Dog food.
No.  Are you proposing?
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Where is escort service?
How long are you planning to stay?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Yes.  Both.
Okay.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
We have no money.  Come on.
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Cut!
Be quiet.  Watch.
As a plumber?!
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
What are you coming here to do?
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
I used an accelerant.
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Sure, what is it?
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
It's possible.
No. I never did, either.
I guess it isn't.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
What is it, Hal?
Yes, it is.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
She's in the bathroom.
Yes, Daddy.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Well, that does sound very odd.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Well, I'm glad about that.
I will if I can, Frank.
True.
I want to pick up my car.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
Must be billy's girl.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
You stay with me...
Luther's on the move...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, I read the report...
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
You sure you want me to?
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
Corn-i-Lius?
They are robots!
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
It means, "Never without my permission".
One more reason to shoot first eh?
What is?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Perfect.
Who?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
How do I look?
How many points you got left on your license?
...'Scuse me?
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
We will be ready, Lord.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Found it?
Uh... not really.
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
I don't think this is a good time...
He's on vacation.
I'll be right back.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I thought you were divorced.
Uh..you're welcome.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
What is... Make Love?
OK, you can turn around!
Exactly.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
An elephant couldn't crack it.
...What do you mean?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
How much time is left?
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Sir!
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
...I can't wait to be among you.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I understand.
I know.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You don't understand...
What you see is what I got, mister.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
Dino...
I promised him to Machine.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
We can do that.
I'd rather you didn't.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Move it, dirtbag... !
Leave him alone.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You betrayed us.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
You enjoy it?
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Shut up.
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Fuck you.
Yeah... guess so.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Good for you.
Snuff films.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Where does he sell it?
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
I try to be.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
You've found missing persons before.
The checks were for odd amounts...
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
How will I get it to you?
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
It's been six years.
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
Those are her belongings.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
What's wrong?
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Extra money, huh?
Three days.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
It's okay, we're just about there.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
She knew she was gonna die.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
You're not taking my baby!
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Me too.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Alice...
Since my little girl became a mom...
Had kind of a long night.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Mark!
Nobody thinks that.
I don't know!
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Then we'll find another way.
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
Who?
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Yes?
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Huh?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Somewhere down there?
We'll have to look for them later.
Oh it does???
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Right, Skipper.
Seems to be all around...
Yes, Griff?
Wonderful!
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Under <u>water</u>?
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
What direction does the system indicate?
Who with?
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Minus three.
Come where?
- for horrors like yourself?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Twombley involved?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Yeah. I know about that.
Tell me.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Yeah.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Yeah?
You played for the Sox?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Shit.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
What blood?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Yes.
Nothing.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
I'm not saying that.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Yeah. A few things.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
So?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Tonight. Let's get together.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
What way?
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
Wade.
Can --?
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
His office. You mean my old office.
Wade?
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
What about her?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Money.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Not particularly.
Yeah.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
Alice...
I'm sorry, honey.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Did we warn them off?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
I'm doing what I can.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Stay cool.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
To swear you in as President.
Dead.
why did they do that?
We're not going to make it.
Stand by.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
I know he left you behind.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Yes, sir.
Can't it wait?
Rose, I don't have time for this.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
We're under attack.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
That just doesn't make any sense.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Accelerators down.
There's nothing wrong with me!
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Not now, Elaine.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
I think so.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
I don't want to hear that word!
I don't want to live anymore.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Sixteen 'C', why?
What should I say?
Do you have an appointment, sir?
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Well...not for another two hours.
That's right.
Ted!
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Uh-huh.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I will, but Jim won't.
Huh?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Of course.
The cockpit? What is it?
Yeah...
That's right.
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
Yes...
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Did you talk to him?
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
To the... to the beach?
Nothing.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
Fuck procedure.
Ss-ai!
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
... It's Harcourt.
Only holds five.
Who else can I ask around here?
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Sure.  Just a minute.
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Position?
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Yes.  That follows.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
It's insured.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
They're but off!  Do something!
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
...We're coming in.
You tell me.  I only work here.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Fuckin' A!
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
Stand back.
Don't be long, Ellen.
No.  Have you?
You're just reading me.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
What about me?
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Where is she?
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Yes.
A brothel.
You were sublime.
Extremely clever.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
I'm so relieved.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Yes!
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Why? People fart backwards.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Tell them to go!
Your father is dead.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Why?
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Oh, thank you, sir!
He asked me to stay.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Behold!
Michael!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
It's just a trifle, of course.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Yes?
Of course not.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Yes, indeed.
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Ah, love again.
Don't you have a maid?
How is your financial situation?
How many pupils do you have?
Yes.
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Bene.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Madame.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Whom did they choose?
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
I'm afraid not.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
Are you neglecting my request?
This is only a vaudeville.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Of course.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
What?
Oh, yes.
I think so.
Yes.
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
You go fast!
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Because His Majesty wishes it.
On the contrary.
Mozart -
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
I regret it is not too familiar.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
I poisoned his life.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Italian?
I can't wait.
What do you mean - now?
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Who is she?
Yes, I am looking after him.
Of course.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Dr. Hirsch?
Warn him?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
Yes, I should think so.
Yes, Doctor.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Call me Alex.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
I thought you were asleep.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Will you come with me?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Okay.
Don't you remember?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
I swear, I don't know this girl.
David, let's go now.
No.
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
You did, did you?
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
What are you going to see?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Where am I?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
David.
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Shall we?
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Yeah?
I don't know. Come on.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
It's circling us.
Walk away, Jack.
No.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
I can't stand it.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
What?!
I wanted to see you.
Yes.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Hi, David.
You don't have to say anything.
Thank you.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
How much?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Yeah?
Yes, sir.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
Take it easy, Clark.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Line?
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Yes.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Numbers? No, never mind.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
No, sir.
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they?
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
I tell you, I saw them!
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Mr. Williams . . .
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
There you are!
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
I'm okay, Matt.
I guess so.
That was two hours ago.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
What have you done?
Swear.
Hey!
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
What?
You're not scared, are you?
So what do we do, General Lee?
I got three.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Sure, cousin.
And I'm the better outlaw.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Missed you too, cousin.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
The District Marshall
Me get heap firewater --
You're doing just fine.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
What do you think?
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
Jesse, we're outlaws.
If I could go back to farming --
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
No, I --
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
They're making him a hero now.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Pity.
Last February?
You do that.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Lyla Devereux.
Really?
How much did they get from the safe?
I look forward to seeing it.
What, sir?
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
Oh, that's the best part.
So you can't tell me anything?
Can't you tell me anything?
Vengeance.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Nice?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip ? to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
Yes, Courtney?
You just haven't been looking.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
We never really shared one.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
No.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
You saw the ad in the Times?
Yes, naturally.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Uh huh.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Maybe it's just the light.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
New card. What do you think?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
See you then.
When?
Negative. Cancel it.
Just...say...no.
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
What are I doing?
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin閑 of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
Does he do this all the time?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
It's no problem
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Well...
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
Hmmm.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Let's see...  That you were with-
I checked it out. It's clean.
Where was Marcus?
I'm so hungry.
I'm not...
I'm hungry.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Yeah, well, you're late.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
Yes, it is.
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Teddy was killed last night.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
You can't just walk in, either.
Just shut up?
It's gonna get cold.
No.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Gimme the coordinates?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
We tried!
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Skywire.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Let's go.
Just do it.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
I'm calling Gary.
Where we going?
You know my name.
You're famous around here.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
You're compulsive.
Why's that?
The Day Care?
They'd frame him.
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
What about "60 Minutes."
What?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
You mean -- break in?
Gary.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
That's lame, isn't it?
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Wait a second. He knows I know.
I met this girl.
What d'you mean?
What does that mean?
Oh we're not going to the campus.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Or sometimes not at all.
Smashing!
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
Yes?
Oh, and Austin...
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
What?
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
What?
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
I'm sure.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
Let me see.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
You know who.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Yes.
Sure.
Where did you learn to shoot?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Yes.
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
... preserve...
... love ...
So I'm still ...
Sir August...?  What now?
Impossible?
I have an appointment.
Eh? In here!
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Hmmm ...
Thank you, Steed.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
You killed my husband.
Ring?
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
Whereas you are.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Mother?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
An eccentric recluse?
June, July ... August?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Winning isn't everything.
You don't trust me?
It's called Black Leather.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
You first.
But --
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Still a bit chilly ...
Have you any place in mind?
Not quite.
... and now?
I shall need a small plane.
Global warming?
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Where?
I was at Harrow ...
You wish.
Did I? My mistake.
You are, and it's behind you.
Really -- you went with him for two years.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
You're kidding.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, sir, I am.
1002.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
I am committed. I love you.
Let's get naked.
You're so romantic...
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
You know your father enjoys his company.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
I think I screwed that one once.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
What are you talking about, asshole?
What are you...
Let's have a toast.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
What do you mean, it changes?
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah, I guess so.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
You can tell a man by his friends.
The phone made me do it!
No, Brett, I...
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Olivier's in that, right?
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I don't know.
Got me.
Who's your friend?
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
Yeah? What about Laura --
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
This?
What, are you kidding? By myself?
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
How's it going?
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Well, you did invite me here.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Just take it.
Who's doing this?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
But the right guess on this is arson.
What?
Are you going public with this?
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Yeah? Airtight?
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
No.
Yeah.
Four months.
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Engine 115, right?
And DIE!
Cute.
Fixing my roof.
The great communicator.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Okay.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Absolutely.
I might.
"Don?"
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Investigator...
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Nah...
You mean you could use it.
Me?
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
I forgive you.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
Are you sure?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
What money?
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
Yes, Sister?
YEAH!
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
What are you talkin' about?
Meaning?
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
How much?
And I'm the feet.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I've never been given a fair shot.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
I'm wid it.
Go on.  Good so far.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
We think so.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
Calm down, please.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
Pleased to meet you.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Is that so?
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
The pleasure is mine.
I thought it was appropiate.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
He's just playing big brother.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
I don't believe it.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Not at all?
Soon.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
The one with da big...
She hates dem.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
...too early...
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
What do you want to know?
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Just a little something' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Never read a book in my whole life.
You look beautiful like that.
And what?
Just ask me what you want to know.
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
You can go now.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
How do you do, sir?
And his baggage?
Your cousins go out with him.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
It must have been some other gate.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Your honor must lower his voice.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
I have faced that problem before.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Old fool!
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
The Prince left him only that choice.
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
We found him like this --
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
I'm serious --
I didn't shoot West --
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Why?
So did we. Why didn't you come?
I...
We just want to check your pack --
Yeah...
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
But you didn't.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
No. I said Dunbar.
Well?
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
Because I was standing next to him.
And the problem is you only got three.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Who killed Pike?
The Senator...
I'm not even going to dignify that --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Yes.
Why?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
I plan to grow on you.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
I lied. Wait for it...
I don't think that has anything to do with --
I don't know.
What happened next?
Good idea.
You couldn't have known --
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Right back where we started.
I should probably write that down.
What are you talking about?
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Oh, you remember now --
He whispered it in my ear.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Childs.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
What the fuck are you doing?
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Shut up!
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
That's great.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Yes!
Who is she? Where does she live?
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
There's only one I want.
Fine, I will.
Fine, I'm doing it.
I brought it.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
How did you know?
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
I see. I thank you for your time.
Go.
I know.
No, I understand.
I like your stories.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Am I?
Really.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Okay.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Yes.
Can we talk?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
You say...
Go out with me.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
Because he's dying.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
Yes.
I'll help you.
I need to lie down for a bit.
Probably tonight.
Did you?
That's because most of it never happened.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
We rented a car.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Of course.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Good. 
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
What?
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
Oh nothing.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
Sorry?

What's wrong?
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
It's none of your business.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Why not?
You don't want to talk about it.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
And. It's wrong.
Sometimes.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You didn't mind too much.
Thank Christ for that.
Well what have you got?
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Except for Small Eyes.
It's alright.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Tell me about it.
Maybe you will find out.
Right.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Yeah, I know.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
You take her to a doctor?
You liked what I brung ya?
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Hey.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
You been home yet?
You need a ride?
That's not right, really, cuz I...
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
I got others.
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
And you gonna live it with him?
Let go of my arm...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
What do you want?
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
Whose doin' is that?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Sure.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
Yeah, gal I been here before.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Maybe I won't.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Now, hold up.
What'chu sayin'?
Uh-huh.
Nuh-uh.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
Don't know if God wanna see me.
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
Or what?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
One thing at a time, Laz.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
Hey.
You feelin' sick?
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
Got in a little accident.
Thought you had a man for that.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Get rid of it.
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Maybe we should do something?
No.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Nick, we can't just --
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Cool?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Give me a break, would you?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
Give us a break...
You were too far behind.
Gaiijin.
A resort city, Beppu.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
I don't know.
Me too.
Why's that?
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
I need someone to translate for me.
You met her.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
The cheese...
I'm taking you back.
Guess I'm on a roll.
Time, I've got plenty of.
What?
Right.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
It is not allowed.
You're foreigners.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
I have to get to Sugai.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Death.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
I am?
Well, actually
You're just all so... so different.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
When do you deliver your project?
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Got it.
Yeah.  I got it.
Your customer, eh?
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
Why, yes, of course.
I know all that.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Shot of vodka, please.
Prosit.
I don't know.
Four years.
Sorry.
No.  I got a problem.
I'm taking a piss.
Meaning?
Huh huh.
True.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Of course.
What night?
You mean the snake.
Sorry.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
I work alone.
Right.
You did?
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
Like?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Because it's not.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
No, I don't.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Go ahead.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Thirteen.
I'm tired of this.
What desert?
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
Is that why you're still here?
Really?
For how long?
Young man, stop right there!
Do ya?
Are you French?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Oh, that's nice.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
Heck, no!  What?!
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
How long would you need me?
My Mom and Dad.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Sorry.
What for?
Sure.
Um-hum.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Yeah.
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Well, you had better!!
Is that what you call it?
It was at least as good as the sky.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Yes, sir.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
No, son. A pitcher.
Why?
Then why go there?
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
I promise. Is that all?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
You nut!
Really?  Since when?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Yeah?
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
What?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
I'll be all right.
Yes, ma'am.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Yes, ma'am.
Are you in trouble, son?!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Yes.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
You bet, hon!
Yes.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
To you maybe.
What?
Honey?
Right here!
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Yes.  Well... yes.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
--and we will--
--do as I say!
I thought ten years.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
I knew you'd like him.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
What's that supposed to mean?
He's from Alaska.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
He didn't leave with them.
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
You're goddamn right I am!
Coward!
Then what?
What?!
Roger, Wolf One.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Yes.
It must be great.
Yes.
Yeah.
No, not at all.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Nobody.
No. Come on.
I'll go then.
You don't?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I, uh.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Same here.
No.
Frank is coming?
Whatiya mean?
Frank would open you.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Kiss me.
Do you love me?
I did. Are you?
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
I want you to stay with me.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
My bourbon.
Here's to Ben.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Yeah. okay.
I'll get a coat for her.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Uh-uh.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
That's too bad.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Where are they?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I'm here, aren't I?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
I'll drink to that.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Yeah.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
Actually. I've been in twice.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
I can't dance fast.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Go ahead.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Got it.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
What?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
I-I'll tip her.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Connor, is that you?
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
How many?
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
What?
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Holy shit. Who? How many?
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
He's a good man.
Rule of thumb?
Uh... two shooters!
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
You killed my... my...
Pee...Per...Man.
The fat man.
What?
Twist of lemon!
Who were the victims?
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
I...
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Yeah boss?
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Right. The blond guy.
Dignan, it's --
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Yeah, I saw it.
That sets it off.
We got it. We got it.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
I keep it for emergencies.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Sure.
What. What's the matter?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
As long as he gets out OK.
This was in fourth grade.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
We said 48 hours.
If you say so.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
What?
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
I know.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
I know that. But --
Shut up!
Who's Mr. Henry?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Bob!
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
I'll see you there.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Oh, I'd say about --
He stole a tractor.
You're kidding.
Grammar.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
So do I.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
What do you mean?
Yes, he did.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Death.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
I didn't do anything.
No.
Cuba.
Abdul-Shabazz?
That's your friend Anthony?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
You're the faggot.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Not even for emergencies?
I thought your parents were in Italy.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
He electrocuted someone?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
He wouldn't move.
See you in a little while.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
I don't know.
We'll have to see when we get back.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
I'm going back.
Watch me.
I can't do that, Bob.
Bullshit.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
I didn't have any choice.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Run. Run. Let's go.
I'm working on it.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
We're just going over a few things.
Well, I think --
Who? Applejack?
No. I just have short hair.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Will it track back to us?
What do you mean?
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
I'm sorry, Ward.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
'Why' would be enough for me.
No. You lost your way.
Okay.
Then what?
-- take the back -- get another car --
Conklin up front.
I should be better by now.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
He was at the campground yesterday.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
We can't wait to be sure.
-- where? -
But you found another choice.
Yes.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
I killed him???
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
Your first assignment was Geneva.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Careful...
Are you disappointed?
What's that?
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
And the Germans can't match it?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
Me? Four years.
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
It is suicide.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
The Scots will fight for us?
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Aye.
I rest.
How many?
Armed?
That depends on the man.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Thank you for inviting.
I... accept your proposal!
Nor I!
You scare me.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
And I with you. But you must wake.
How do you know this?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
It does me good to see you.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
How soon?...
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you protect me?
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Where are my goddamn books?
But I... I need those books.
I thought you were a December baby.
Huh?
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I'm sorry.
Damn. Your dad did this?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
Of course.
So it didn't feel... weird?
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
You'll see.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Why's that?
Know what?
Which is?
...yes.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Evan Treborn.
Deal. Now read me something.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What happened?? Where are we?!
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Yes?
I came with Captain Renault.
Well?
Thank you, but I hardly think --
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
And the carrying charges?
Well, so long.
We said "no questions."
And I was wondering.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
You can believe that if you want to.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
Richard, I had to see you.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Won't you join us?
Be careful.
Goodnight.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
He suggested I ask you.
-- Yes?
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
What of it?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Yes, I get the point.
Yes.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
We'll be there.
I slept very well.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
Are you quite finished with us?
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
What, again?
Why two?
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
What is your nationality?
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Put that phone down!
-- You thought what?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Not right now.
Good. Then have a drink.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Just a little something of my own.
Going to die anyway.
Take it, damn it.
Why do they have to die for me?
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
There was an unavoidable delay.
As much as anybody.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Let's take a look.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
You want to.
I can't take him to work.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
Is that Jango?
My epitaph.
Great.  Really.
You too.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Don't you even think about it.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
What's going on down there?
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
We're on.
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
Want to see my raft?
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
Permission granted.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
Life is waiting.
They just want you to hire some new help.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Good night, Daddy.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Okay...
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
"King Kong". It's really good.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
What do you want me to *do*?
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
Sure. Thanks.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
They wanted a girl.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
It's okay--I don't mind.
Have you enlisted?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
What about the trees?
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
Is it true?
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Where'd she get you?
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
I don't know it.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Tough day?
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Everything looks in order.
Know who I am, Jake?
And these cops? What do they get?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
It's not true.
After you cut her loose.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Two million.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
You sure?
That's it.
I'd like this cashed, please.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
I have a good crew.
I can't do that.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
I think I just broke my hand.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Sure.
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Don't worry about it.
What?
Why?
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Intuition.
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
What about what?
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
What do we need another Shill for?
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Where the hell is she?
And we got rid of the red head.
I'm sorry.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
Eee Oott Auught!
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
A little bit of both.
I can handle it.
It's not history.
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
A Fed? Is he close?
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
That's it?
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
That's what I'm talking about.
I can imagine.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
Habib?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
How did you land that?
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
You've got such beautiful hands.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Marion. It's a book.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
You will?
Gambling's not about money.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
I hate public transport.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
It's not that.
You know where I'm from?
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
First visit to London?
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
The debts.
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
I'll watch.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Who's they?
You're serious.
Have I?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Nice car.
You've done pretty well.
Good call. Help yourself.
That bitch? No.
I don't gamble.
I was at Beadles.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
Five.
How?
Very impressive.
Does he win?
I can see.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
What flickering light?
Eventual supernova.
Key? Key? What is the key?
The key!
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Energy shielding positive function.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Hello, bomb.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
To explode, of course.
I have no proof that it was false data.
I'll check it.
Any planets?
Who cares?
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Not now!
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What was that, Doolittle?
It didn't work?
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Phenomenology...
Bruno's girlfriend.
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
What the hell are you doing?
Where?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Don't look down.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
Later.
Every week.
They took my daughter.
I don't want to move away.
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Mommy, where are you?
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Wasn't that hard.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
It was open.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
That would be appropriate, yes.
You did go through my stuff.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
Any idea when she'll be back?
A friend of your fiance's.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You're also a fool.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Where?
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
And because he's my friend.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
I actually know how this works.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
Pull the cash.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
What if he's on the level?
But there's another side--
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
--a philandering pig.
I'll give it my best shot.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
Shut-up...
I was on call. 
He's sick.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Believe it.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Right, slow...
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
One more time in English.
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
The easy way.
Hawk?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
They're what?
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
That's it?
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Hello summer detention.
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Yeah, you did!
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Donnie.
So... that's it?
A metal craft of any kind.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
I didn't say shit.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
I am so sorry.
We went to a hotel.
I don't wanna talk about it.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Until it withers away.
And you'd never been there before?
Yeah?
Why?
What?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
The whole movie. Let's go.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Do they know yet?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
Yes.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I... I was playing with fire.
But you were punished.
If God exists?
I have the power to build a time machine.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Because you tell Mom everything.
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
Come again?
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
It is a big deal.
What else?
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
Kitty...
But now you can't go.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Oh-yah.
Really?
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Here, have some.
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Yes...
Then it must be Wednesday.
Bye.
You could be quiet.
Loretta, shut it.
So? Be real easy.
Anyone?
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Ohio...
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Tammy Curry?
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Yeah.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
The President of the United States.
"My"...
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Send for my car...
Yes, sir. 
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
She did.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
$50?
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
Why -- why -- of course.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Oh, would you...?
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
Perhaps he will listen to you...
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I'll get my bag.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
I intend to.
Everything will be seen to.
You don't own this man!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Oh no, my friend...
Oh, yes.
Yes.
...I learned a long time ago.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
My name is...
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Thank you very much.
That's a canopy, John.
How is your tea, John?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Your mother?
Yes, John?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Yes, John.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
A dressing bag.
Welcome home, John.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
It was different...
And I thought you said it was something special...
But, Erik...
Why?
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
I'm sure it's lovely.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
You've got to let me go!
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
What -- rape?
What?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Well... no...
He was lucky...  Sit there.
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
She got me thinking...
Row! Row! Row!
So?
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Like fish.
I've got you!
No! Arrgh!
Oh... er... yes...
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
How about making friends?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
I was sitting there.
Let me do something for myself for a change!
You will wait?
Please.
Do what?
He hasn't.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
No, it is NOT.
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
That's right.
YOU do it!
Help!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
Dad!
Yes, Mother.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Hi.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
Okay, I guess.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I'm Joel.
I'm not nuts.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Yeah?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
You know Wilmont?
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
I know a man who needs a refill.
Yeah?
No.
Oh, yeah.
You'll call me, right?
When?
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Where are you going?
I don't want to talk about this here.
Would you get me another, Joely?
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
I'm right here.
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
I love it!
Is that what you want?
Okay.
I think she's great.
Oh.
What are you doing?
Joel, come here. Please.
I'm nervous, too.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
I just walked in.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Hi.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Long day thinking.
And what are you like? A wino?
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Very cool. Trippy.
Hi.
I better do this, Stan.
Well, what should we do?
Do you swear you didn't know?
Thanks, Stan.
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Alexander Pope?
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
He went home sick.
She came to help, Howard.
That's fine, Stan.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Then check the connections.
Yeah.
Just wanted to let you know.
Patrick, we need to focus.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Save your breath for the climb.
Siwash, huh?
I don't.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clich閟 and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
Well.... er...
I was a successful model once.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
A born freak can only go uphill.
A job for me?
I don't know anything about it.
Coop, where are you...
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
It is not.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
What you got, Peters?
...how's the client?
Skipper...
...you okay?
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
It's complicated...
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
Son of a bitch!
What makes you think I'll miss?
Then who the fuck are you?
I'm not the Devil.
Starck... Cooper...
Locked and cocked.
Starck...
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
That's enough!
Captain, we got a problem.
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
I just finished drying...
How much oh-two do we have?
Carbon dioxide?
Do it. Dr. Weir...
No. It was someone else.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
I did.
Can you shut it down?
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
It's easy for you to be patient.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Got it, teach.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
You've been working out.
I can go hotter!
Johnny.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
I was talking about us. Working together.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
And reverse the mutations --
You were?
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben did this.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Arnold. What's happening?
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Later.
This is how I dress all the time.
They're not home yet.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Where did you hear that?
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
No.
Get a ride with somebody.
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
All right, I take it back.
We've got to get an abortion?
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
She's in my biology class.
Yeah?
Damone. It's Mark.
Damone! You come here?
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Chicken!
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Yes.
I've been swimming, Merv.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Totally.
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
Believe it.
It was nice.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Climax together.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
That little prick.
He's not coming.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
You're gonna flunk me?!
All right! Oh, yeah!
Aloha, Spicoli.
No problem.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
The point sounds fine.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Sure thing.
I've heard that, too.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
I'd like that.
Awake? What do you mean?
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Naked.
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
What?
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
My heart!
Lacerda?
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Not much. Why?
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
Where'd you get this?
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Right!
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
Of course, officer.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
Spare me.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
We can't risk letting them in.
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
They'll be back.
Nah, I got the gun.
With what just happened upstairs --
OPEN THE DOOR!
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
Oh yeah?
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Who's with me?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
What's in the back?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Well...
Oh.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
The girl's got rhythm.
Huh?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Two.
Seven.
Seven.
Gimme the keys.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
I'm fine! I'm fine!
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
And the last one is the...
GO-GO-GO!!
Oh...
Who's this?
You see: We've got to change that name.
I'm not!
Frances.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
No?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
I know you believe that.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
We'll get you home, Frances.
But I'll never win that.
Thank you.
I didn't have much to do with it.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Please, Francie...
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Are you an actor?
Enh.
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
Quietly.
Yeah.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Kaminski.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Yeah.
Forget it.
Frances...
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Who said I was a lady?
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
Whattaya think you're in now?
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
I got your number, Mister Man.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
Oh Harry...
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
No.
Just a little way.
Run!
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
I already have.
You got it.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
Where are you going?
Not long.
Sure.
Mama...?
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
I will, I promise.
But what -- 
Don't I know you?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Please sit down...
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
You're kidding.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
You drove him to his torment.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Worse.
You speak.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
Her body pleases me.
Quite right!
And you look so lovely.
It's been months. It's not like him.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
Open this door for no-one!
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
It's a letter to my father.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
Victor, explain yourself.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
You know of it?
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
I will protect you.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Thanks, Alice.
Sure.
You okay?
You're right. It makes no sense.
Artist.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
I'll go take a look.
Wet. I don't know.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
Oh, you...
Somebody'll see.
For sure.
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
Ned!
I call it my shower dream.
Mmmmmmmph.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Rocky Road.
One night on the town.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
I have no idea.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
He's my son.
On the dresser.
Come again?
My wife.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Yes, they do.
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You won't let him touch her?
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
No!
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
What's in Mexico?
What you said to me in the room.
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Me too.
Later.
-- you got your microwave --
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Knock yourself out.
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
One... Two... Three.
Sight seein'.
What?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Seth, if you were me --
What?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
That's what you look like.
No, Richie, what do I look like?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
Okay, I'll have one.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Standing right here in my office.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
I'm fine, sir.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
No, sir.
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Sir?  What did he say?
Sir...
Motherachrist...
Smoke her.
I'll act surprised.
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
'Snot me.  It's him.
I can make this wall without --
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Just like you would be.
Which is guy-speak for...
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
What about him.
That's a good story.
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
You heard me.  Move on.
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
No.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
North?
Darth Vader reads poetry...
You knew about us?
The first female President?
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Great. See ya then.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
What do I get?
Five bucks.
So have dinner with me tonight.
It's your choice.
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
I don't think so.
Me too.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
You're standing on it.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
But you don't know for sure!
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
...Damn you!  Damn you!
Like YOU know?
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Nothing.
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Could they be the miners?
Down there.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
What's  your name, son?
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Yes Commander?
Lt. Madison, GO.
Up.
We're getting major structural damage.
There is no weather in space.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
Never mind, Fred....
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
Something BAD happened here.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Yeah, what is it?
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
We're doing episode 31?
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
You smiled at me.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Tell them? About...
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
Closer?  I can try.
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
NO, Thank God he has not.
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
I think we're going to exit the space port.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Get oacK on their tail.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Delighted, sir.
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
Lafayette is a child!
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
What's the difference?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
I understand, George.
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
The man is a traitor!
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
I... they look both the same.
I only meant...
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
I think I heard that.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
It's stupid, of course.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
I think I will disappoint you.
That's good... who?
That land belongs to the strongest.
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Juba was a Numidian.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Come here, Farrah...
You spotted them, huh?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
You can talk to me.
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
Bear, you're not really gonna ?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Leo, I don't know.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
Depends. Who's this?
Okay. So who are you?
Who?
Look at me, Ray.
That's correct. Look at me.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
I don't like waiting.
What've you got?
Where you been, Harry?
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
I said I had an idea, that's all.
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
Who's the star?
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Personally?
What Get Away jet?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
With what? Wiseguy money?
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
They report it to the IRS.
How'd you know I was here?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
What're you doing here?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
And you think the movie business is any different?
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
You thought I was faking?
What happened?
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
You bet.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Be quiet and listen.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Oh, yeah, sure.
'We?'
What money?
Shylock?
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
A passenger liner. Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
What?
Maureen?
No.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Or uninvited guests.
Oh yeah.
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
Smugglers maybe.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
How about you Epps?
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
What is it?
What do you propose?
I don't know what you're talking about?
Maybe you can tell me then.
You smashed it!
Right.
There's a charming thought.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Probably didn't have time.
No.
Lights?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yup.
Epps.
But where's the damage?
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Showing you what?
Victims of what?
What's that supposed to mean?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Of course they did.
Sorry.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Drink up then.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
A what?
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Fine with me.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Who?
Not the Maxine?
What is it now?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Are you going to yell at me?
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Uh-oh.
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Well, yes...
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Jesus...
I guess.
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
That's just the way I am!
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What?
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Just look at them!
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
In fact, never.
Or maybe not.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
I can't believe it!
We should follow him home.
Come on, it's too late now...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
Let's go hassle Josh.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
What? Where?!
I don't believe you.
Where did you get that?
He does that every single day.
Yeah, I guess... call me...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You're insane.
What are you talking about? Who?
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Nothing.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
Maybe an orange juice.
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Seymour does.
Get a job!
Well why do I care about that?
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Watch my stuff.
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Oh, right...
Yeah, well...
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Really?
How can you be so sure?
What? You're kidding me...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
What?
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
They're Seymour's.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I wish I could see him.
Yeah.
Right, exactly!
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
How; we don't know where they are?
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Don't they, though?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
Have you ever failed?
What happened to them?
Don't they have to be?...
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
Not even close.  What happened?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
We don't have a relationship.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
Certainly.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Now you're talking.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
The Upper West Side.
I await the word of Vigo.
Did I forget something?
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
His nickname is "The Hammer."
And we're the ...
Something good --
Do it!  Just do it!
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
Are you sick, Louis?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
That's a violin concerto.
Well, let's check it out.
Are you all right?
All right.
Goodbye.
You heard it?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Talk to my accountant. 
We'll get back to you.
Die in what sense?
What is it?
The EPA?  What's he want?
Are you Peter Venkman?
You could say that.
I'm not at liberty to say.
In a storage facility.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
That's "Peck!"
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yes.  I don't like this.
Two wavy lines?
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
What have you got, Egon?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
I agree.
Gozer.
We'd better adjust our streams.
Neutronize.  System shut.
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
To go into business for ourselves.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
No sense worrying about it now.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
And the seas would boil ...
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You're coming back?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
What are you talking about?
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Gladly Caesar.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
He left us at dawn.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
But have never been?
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
Why do you play at being drunk?
Would that Marcus had lived.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
They fear me.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
What deal?
My troops don't make policy.
I can't let you do that.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
You teach them!
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
Hello.
I'd love some.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
No -- why should I?
Yes, I do.
Wait a minute.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Yes.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
At the Zoo.
Here he comes.
Come in.
All right then! Yes!
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Shhhh.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
What?
Mr. McQuire.
Not exactly.
Ahhh.
What?
Who screamed?
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Yes.
Could you bring it up?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
It's in the main ballroom.
What? No. Nothing.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
What?
Right.
Why not?
Yes.
What do you mean?
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
What?
What?
Like what?
All right. Now finish your drink.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Where is it?
Get away from that door.
Jesus Christ!
Oh my God.
I've got to go.
Yes.
What?
I haven't. No.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
The number.
Either one will be fine.
You're welcome.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Don't you?
What one.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
No.
Not exactly.
What?
How do you think.
Oh my God.
Don't talk about Elaine?
There's nothing to tell.
But why shouldn't I?
Then let's hear them.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Benjamin?
You're not.
Now don't start this.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Of course you did.
If that's how you feel --
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
When I go off?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
But I don't want you to make up something.
No.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No -- they don't.
We haven't.
-- worried?
What about it?
You got me.
That has nothing to do with it --
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Oh no.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
I'd like to hear it.
Oh no.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
No, it's not --
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
Can you look through the glass.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
Dad -- can you listen --
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Yes.
Why?
I could take care of her.
You can't.
Who?
Have you seen it?
Dictation.  You know...
No -- why? -- should I?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Why do you hide in my room?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
So alone.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Yes -- I do understand.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
I don't want them now.
Yes.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
For Vienna?
Bless you --
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
How's the beautiful lady?
I thought she was splendid!
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
I did not ask your advice.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
No, doctor.
This gentleman can have my room.
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
The Grand Hotel.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Money!
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Oh yes, of course.
Moreover...
Me.
Moreover...
Have you got it now?
Definitely off.
No -- now.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
I understand perfectly.
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Oh, yes.
I had to arrange about the trip.
Exactly.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
All you have to do is phone for it.
And I said we didn't.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Next week.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Oh -- but it can't be.
Why not?
You haven't time.
Such nonsense.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
I don't know you.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Have I kept you waiting?
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
My son was in the hospital --
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
And if you do it wrong?
What's that, Lilly?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Hah.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Goody!
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
These machines -- They're in here.
I know.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Just myself.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Perk.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
I pay my debts.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
This way's perfect.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
I know you do, so that's why --
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Not very good!
Uh-huh.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
Mm?
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
Mama!
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
That's just Lilly's way.
Oh, come on, Roy.
Myra, I'm not following this.
The long end. Big con.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I thought these people were broke.
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
) What?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
The cemetery...
Charming.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
I think someone broke into my house.
No shit.
Checking out your place.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Nothing's missing?
You're so predictable.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
I know.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Yes.
Get on the bus.
Just get on the bus.
Where'd you get it?
Why not?
Then you come out here.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Who?!
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
Michael Meyers.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Where's Shane?
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
I promise.
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Him.
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
You know what gets me?
You know what gets me?
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
Go home!
You know me, boy.
When?
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
If what?
How are you, honeybunch?
Our pleasure.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
You actually sold insurance!
I just want one true adventure before I die.
You're hollow, like a woman.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
As a matter of fact--
As a matter of fact--I am home.
He worships Father.
They were in the same creative writing class.
What's good about that?
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
Where did you get the poison?
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Penelope!
Damn.
Leave a tip.
You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
What time do you get off work, my child?
You are woman.  I know woman well.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
We thought a doctor might help.
We thought it was an emergency.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Nothing would please me more.
Have some.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
I did?
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
Yes.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
Yes.
Sneaking in the back door.
If he wants to go.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
I see.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Blue soup?
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
I've literally got to run!
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Would you say that again?
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
What for?
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Yes.
Now who's being cruel?
Comical?
And terror, if you don't mind.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
My violin is avenged!
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
There was so much going on.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
What will you do, Colonel?
I heard you were looking for me.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
Stay home tonight!
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
Still lives with his mother.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
He isn't any friend of Father.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
I know.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
A what?
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
Marry me instead.
You're saying no.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
Tell her to have a nice trip.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
No.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
You mean I'm black?
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
But is she, has...
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
How many weeks?
That's all you got, three girls?
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
What's that shade of blue called?
Overpowering?
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Do you know where she would be?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
She's dead.
Tijuana.
He deals in pain.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
No, please go on.
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
So then, Mr. Mast...
...What do you have to offer?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
No.
Who made it?
What's it called?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
What is going on?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
Where is she? Where is the girl?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
You're taking a big chance.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
You working in San Diego now?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Hello.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Is this your shovel?
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Then whose name is it registered in?
Lady! Be quiet.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
I'm a file clerk.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
Eh, no.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
My door is always open.
Eh, fine.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Over there by the courthouse.
But this is public property.
No more revolts.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
I like you, Maude.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Where's that?
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
At a funeral.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Does that worry you?
Why?
Ah, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
Yes.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
God, that's terrible.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
The boxes! I TOLD you.
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
It's been Hell.
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
The Cenobites.
See what??
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Reliquary --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Noooo! Noooo!!!
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
You call that thing a cigar??
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
Yes?
Not from you.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Coffee's warming me up.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
What?
What's the problem?
Sure.
Who are you?
No. That wasn't the deal.
Oh Christ.
No.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
Poor baby.
A box?
And the blood let you out?
I don't.
Maybe.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
The keys are in the kitchen.
Where's Daddy?
Like who?
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
Shit.
So damn stupid.
Are you O.K.?
O.K.
I've seen worse.
Fine.
He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
Not much.
Just soda.
Do you care ?
That's right.
What happened to me?
Wait a moment --
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Try me.
Daddy?
I found a room.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
You like?
Is Julia here?
I love you, honey.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Gone?
Yes!
What's the problem?
That's right. Cointreau.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
We walk.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Don't let them take me, Steve --
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
What do you mean, "what?"
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
Ehh.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
What band?
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
Nothing.
You can be and are wrong.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
So.  Is now a good time?
What do you mean, four more?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Fine.
Yeah.
-- FUCK OFF!
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
You look upset.
Think about it, Rob.
I should be so lucky.
Hi.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
You really believe that?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Nevermind.
Is what better?  Better than what?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
It was kind of funny.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Mmm hmm.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Hey, how ya doin'?
I can't talk right now.
No, no.  When are you going home?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
To make you feel better.
No, but...
Harder.
No use.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
I mean it.
Would you marry me if I was?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
How're you holding up?
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Oh, right.  Alright.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Right.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Sixty.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Sure.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Basil the II.
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
I've been to Church Hill.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Tradition.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
No one knows you're here?
You've been listening to rumors.
Yes.
Yes.
Why are you here?
I see.
That would be difficult to explain.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
Of bodies.
Thanks.
What do you want from me?
Four?
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
You're a long way from Inverness.
You are the same?
I don't know why.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
What?
No!
You will live.  Survive.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
I'll be back when I can.
I have no future husband.
What would you like?
Like you.
Far away.
If you wish to play games, Major.
It can be different.  It must be.
I had no choice.
Must he go?
Where did you learn that?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Kahn?
Head still secure to the neck.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
-Since you last saw me.
Leave her out of this.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
It's all we have.
Leave her alone.
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
What's the idea of locking this?
Sort of a Jack London style?
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
The Criminal Courts Building.
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Where'd she go?
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
How?
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
Out of the mouths of babes.
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
I notice you still remember it.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
No, I can't.
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Get away, Svengali.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
You're not afraid, are you?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
No kidding?
Thanks.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
I know. Where is he, I said.
Where's some paper?
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
Okay, Walter. 
Is he coming back here?
You been in a fight?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Walter!
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
What's that -- what's that?
You know you did!
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
They can't do that to me!
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Me, too.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Three bullets! Any good?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Three sixes. Is that any good?
So long, Hildy.
Good coffee, isn't it?
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
Just -- one -- second!
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Go on -- shoot me!
Now, Hildy --
I can't.
Editorials?
What did you do with her?
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
No -- what?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Mother!
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Very simple, Earl.
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
Don't move!
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
They're not human!
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Quiet, Mollie!
Ssh!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
Huh?
The what?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
No, I don't think so.
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
A very fine-looking women.
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
We want to see you.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
She and Mollie were talking.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
Looking for shrapnel.
They're not.
I don't mind.
Bloody.
He's the worst liar.
The sodding water table.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
They might be.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
Jam.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Half the time he's bluffing.
The ideas you get in your head.
No, I won't.
Up to six weeks, I think.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
We did the decent thing.
You might still have a house.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
Really, that's a long time.
Who's your Daddy!
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
OK.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
OK.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
You know... a couple of queers.
Fucking great.
You shouldn't a done that.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Thanks.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
Lock the fucking doors.
It's a girl.
There's not enough room.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
It won't work.
That kid is one horny retard.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
He should be back in a couple hours.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Tell me about it.
I can't believe...
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Yeah, no mercy here.
You find something, Georgie?
Keys.
Yes, sir.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Huh?
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Enough with the stupid voices.
No, just a little too old.
Let's go see.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
What! God damn, how many?
Well, go get her.
Shhhh... you hear that?
I ain't got a warrant.
Call Wydell.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Right...  ...come on.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Shh.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
No. You look so beautiful.
We still have you and I.
Very well.
I want to be the way I was before.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
Ouch. Yeah?
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Really?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
One night stand?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Ready!
Oh, Rosie.
Shut up, you.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
How's it going?
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
Nathan!
Yes, darling.
Of course.
That's very funny.
What?
A deer?
I think he's feral.
Your entire body?
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
I guess.
That was wonderful!
Oh boy!
Should I come with?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Ugnh.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Even better.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Got it.
Yes... Derek.
You want a chaser?
I've never been to Louisville.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
You know what's good for him?
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
You ever played billiards before?
Deal the cards.
Oh, about five hundred.
Twelve thousand.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Kiss off.
You know everybody, don't you?
Where do I sign?
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
How good is he?
Come on, let's go...
I don't know.
I said we're leavin'.
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
I feel tight -- but good.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
A son.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
I told you you'd get your money back.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Okay?
Yeah, sure has.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Ten dollars.
Hi.
Couple of bucks.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Shoot.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
No, not always.
I'm not.
I drink.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
No.
Give me a drag.
Mm hmm.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Is that what makes a winner?
I love you.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
Thousand dollars a game.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
My name is Robert.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
We move.  Place to place.
My wife.
Yes.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
Who?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Yes.
Yes.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Please.
That's fine.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
Do we have to?
That's the Air Force Base.
Because the sky is so clear out here.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I'll take you to school.
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
I'd believe him.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Who are you calling?
I know a way.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Oh?
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I take it you've heard.
He's a good man.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
Then get them out of there.
Haven't you been watching?
Dad, don't start.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
Can't this thing go any faster?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
What'd I say?
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
You as well.
She should be shortly.
But what, General?
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
It had been deemed classified.
No Sir. Definitely not.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He's doing a good job.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Butt-munch.
Butt-munch.
He's my angel.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
We're already over Mach 2!
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
But, Mr. President...
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Deploy.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Air... water... your "sun."
And I am his.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Yes?
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
You said go between them!
You had it? You didn't trust me!
All I have to do is scream.
Out!
Don't call me that, please.
Right.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Yeah?
So did I.
All right Dad -- tell me.
What about Marcus?
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
I don't know. We'll find out.
Dad, we're well out of range.
Junior?! Dad...
Come on -- come on!
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Just a routine inspection tour.
You think so?
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
You're betrayed Shiva. 
What evil?
Long ago -- before my father's father.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
The old man saw it in a dream.
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
No -- real food.
Don't catch cold.
What -- the bug?
You've got to go to sleep now.
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
What above the curves?!
Not quite.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
What for?
Al ???!!!
You're not gonna believe this...
Where are we now?
Right.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Who am I?
No.
Then I'm crazy.
Then what are you stopping for?
Too late...They want you.
Find You?
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Who did?
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
Just scratched my arm, why?
Who cares?
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
What is it?
The sand.
Why not?
What can I do? You're on your own.
Wait.
Where are you staying?
What?
I made it work.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
You have no taste.
What glasses.
I don't know what's going on.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
It's not your time. I get time off.
It wasn't like that.
Run, stupid!
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
You think. That's what you're good at.
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
Come on.
Well...?
Aim what?
...Shit! It's just money.
And don't let her know, either.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Rene?
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
I'll get us out of here.
It's all we've got.
Let us get to the border!
**?!! 
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
It's just money.
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
What about it?
Oh.
Oh...that's okay.
Do what?
Well what?
I feel fine.
Not you. Them.
I don't know Who.
I noticed you staring.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Just give me the keys.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Where?
...right here too.
Do what?
Without what?
...Rene.
I just work for the travel firm.
Me still. They left you alone?
Why?
It's not apparent.
Hires you for what?
How often they come here?
What do you mean?
There's not much to tell.
Last night?
No, he didn't do that.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Why?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Oh sure.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
I asked him.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
You can say that again. What do we do?
It was my choice.
I'll come back for you.
It was you.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
...Piece of mind.
Thanks.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Perfectly.
It'l be alright.
It doesn't hurt.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Lowell?
I'll be there.
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Maybe later.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
No, I'm not...
Before you go...
What caliber is your gun?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Hey, Lowell.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Yes, it's on the stove...
No, thank you.
I'm doing an interview.
"60 Minutes"?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
I'm alone on this...
Get some perspective, Lowell.
Alright.
I'll call you then.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
Hardly new news.
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
What?
What?
Oh, lots.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Oh, please, Mike...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Like what?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
No.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
I don't know what to do.
No.
What?
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Where you staying now?
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
It acts as a...
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Chapter and verse.
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Howard!
I had no idea until after, but --
Is that... one person?
Mr. Dumbarton.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
I should be in therapy.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Thanks, buddy.
You have the pre-nup?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Ruth Rabino.
Why do you think she did it?
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
It's about time.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
Did you see the tape?
Why would you be here?
You just haven't met the right person.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
So I hear. Is that all?
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She held that against you?
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
Your mother was.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Hello Marylin.
I bet.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
May I come in?
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
Marylin?
No buts. Now. Out.
I thought so.
You have some?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Of Massey Myerson?
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Yes?
When you have a moment.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
We've outlined a settlement...
Rex, please.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
I don't know. I can assume...
Well -- is that possible?
She always looked out for me.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
Miles.
Who's "Patty."
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Who's Rex's guy?
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
The reward.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Nothing. 
He's marvelous!
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement梩hat you've had a talk with me梩hat we've reached an understanding梩hat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads梐ll transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
You've made that quite evident梬ith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
I haven't the slightest idea.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Well梠f all the梬ell? Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Yes.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
What are you talking about?
You must have me confused with?
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
That's none of your business.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
I can't go out like this.
Hey梱ou're little, aren't you?
I thought maybe梪h?believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
What are you talking about?
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
You're prejudiced.
was so scared梩hat it scared?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
Hitch-hiking.
Raw?
Amazing.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
What for?
Come on! come on! 
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
I love you.
Same to you.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
You sound like a hobo.
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
When does the bus leave?
Husband?
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars梐nd I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Well, I'll be?
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
I dunno.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Who?
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
There's a seat over there for you.
What's on your mind?
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see梐nd?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with?
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
There were no phone records.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
What's the other name?
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Go on, Willie.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
I did.
No, I did not.
No, I did not.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
No, you don't!
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
I know.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
It's going to get worse, honey.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Take a look across the street.
What are you driving at, boss?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Yes.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
...and your General?
More than ten years.
Never touched me.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
Splendid, love to see them.
That's it.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Yes?
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
I know. That's why I went.
I understand.
Who was there for your ass?
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
A bit.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
I found out.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
Arrest me.
What's in it?
That's my diet shit.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
The Delfonics.
Are you?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
They seem to like the idea.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
Why?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
Set him up.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I'm just tired in general.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
If I'm working, I can help you.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
Do you think I took some of that money?
Buy ya a beer?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Yeah, do you like it?
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
They asked.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
Talk to you tomorrow.
I told them.
But you don't?
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Sure.
Two months shy of four years.
Uh-huh.
What's a Metrix?
No thanks.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
No.
I don't like dancing.
You lived in Japan, when?
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
You live with him.
Uh-huh?
And your point is?
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Okay, Lou-is.
Who's your partner?
Are you serious?
Which one is for the car?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
I dunno.
So we on the same page then?
What does that mean?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Twice. In the parking lot.
In the chest and stomach.
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
It's in there.
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Livingston, huh?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Is that what I think it is?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
Git your ass in here.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
I know where to turn.
'Ola!
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
No problem.
What are you then?
It's short, huh?
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Maybe the demons are real.
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
But the paper ...
He told me he was going to Hell.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
Her knee acting up?
What did she have to say?
She talk about the boys?
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
Wiggle your toes.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
It's good to see you.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
I don't know what to say.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
But I see them.
Whataya mean, no record?
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Who did?
Where is the lamp?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
Jezzie, I can't see.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
It's gone to the top.
Coming here?
That's your decision.
Lie down!
What?
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Stick with me, kid.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You've lived with me for two years.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
What is it?
I no from around here.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Push 'em back.
What is wrong with you?
What?!
That's a lie. My family was here.
Last night! They were as real as you are!
I need to see you, Jake.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Why the hell we drivin' here?
That black car?
Who is?
What do you mean?
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
You come home with me.
How did it happen?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
Speaking of which, duck!
No.
What?
We made it?
Delongpre! Out of time!
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Rizzo did.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
What are you doing back?!!
Thorgan, suit up.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
Suit up.
I am an expert!
My job.
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Where is he?
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
No you don't!
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
I thought you meant...
I'm stuck!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Oh I like her a lot.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
He's right behind us!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Again?! Jesus!
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Would you?
Maybe she tripped.
I'm just saying.
You killed him?
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
Oh shit! There he is!
Am I in there?
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Keep trying!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Get him out of there!
You wanna die?
Hockey player? He's not a ...
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
You got it.
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Do you see the kids?
Older, sillier.
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
My kids were on that beach...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
What stinks so bad?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Florida license plate.
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
I can't imagine why.
I didn't know her.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
That wasn't funny.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
I've got all these signs here...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
I'm okay...
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
And I'll drink to yours.
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
Well, I do.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Were we together?
I totally heard you did.
Yeah. That was me.
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Okay.
Oh, hey Vijay.
I don't really know anything about it.
Excuse me?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
What do you play?
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
Commercials.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
That suits you.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Why?
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
Consider it your musical education.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
What?
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Really? Fingernails?
You found us in the Penny Saver?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Nothing.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Thundercats are go!
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
I'm pregnant.
Right, seriously.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
Hm.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Don't mock me.
Yeah, downtown.
Carrie.
He whips you?
Sure.
Took 'em all.
Early, you are so sweet.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
As many times as it takes.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
What do you need a Bible for?
No sir.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
Who?
Dahlia, no.
Ain't you goin' to record it?
The party?
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
...just like that?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
I still think we should have met them first.
I heard that.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
I'm finished.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
What for? That guys a dick.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Yeah.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
So.
Fifteen for me.
Why not? You stink.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Hold on.
At the block party?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
She won't? Why not?
Yeah. I can understand that.
Tonight?
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
Come on.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
But I'm scared Telly.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
No, Fidget, I...
Yeah.
Why is that?
Yeah?
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
No, I didn't bleed.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Good luck.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
I only did it once and...
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Whah?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Making love is like.
What?!
When are you gonna be back?
Four-thirty in the morning?
It's me. Telly.
Yep.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
I wouldn't know.
No it wasn't.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
No, I need the original note.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
Run it down.
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
It's a voice modulator.
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
I haven't got time for this.
Just a second.  Hello?
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
Where is she?
Not really.
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
The game's over.  You lost.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
No!  Wait!!
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
Fuck off!
He already did once.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Boys.
My cheering section.
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Nothing.
Who's Kathy?
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
But we heard him.
Anything else?
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
We're going to work on the message.
Through a rental agency.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
It doesn't make sense.
Are we going to go through this again?
He knows you're aware of that.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
How come you don't stay with them?
Uh huh.
It is.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
Another kind of game?
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
No.
No.  You were talking about chess.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
No.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
Then why are you backing up?
For emphasis?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
What?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
You don't understand.
He didn't tell you either.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
Well, you're beautiful.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Colwyn ...
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
I don't know how.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
You will know, in good time.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
Saddles.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
You will not, then?
You and I will guard the fire.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
You will follow me.
To the place where Death lives.
I'm all right.
Hand over your dinner.
Yes, my lord.
At the gallop!
I have a cinnamon bar.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
Then look!
Then he will die!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
It is important to assure the succession.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
She has the power to kill.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
It is too late. He has drunk.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
Yes.
Of what?
No.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Do you need money?
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
What, for example?
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
I never rent my gear.
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
What?
What shall we do?
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Fine...
Huh? That's smart!
Huh, that's good!
...And how much is it?
No... Dino's.
No...
Why am I such an authority?
I have new dreams now.
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
That's enough.
I'll kill you!
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Yes.
You're talking to me?
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
Please tell me.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
About my love for her.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
Not our problem.
That's all right isn't it?
Jumped where?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
That's me.
What was that?
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
California.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
She knew you loved her.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
I do.
It's mine to risk.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Someone should be with you.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
What do you mean?
What are my choices?
No.
Water.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
OK.
I know that...
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
Can we just forget it?
Yeah... I'd like that.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Yes.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
Yuri... are you...
I have a 4.0.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Who could better understand than me?
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Yes.
Who's askin'?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
Just the love in my heart.
See?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
How about --
No!
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Relation?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
You're kidding!
Yes, you are.
Yes, he is.
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
Thank you. I love you, too.
Power yoga?
I will...
Not yet.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
I wasn't gonna --
She's completely untrustworthy.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Maybe not to your face...
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
For a butt-head? Yes.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
What happened?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
So are you!
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
No.
No, silly. I go here.
What, like it's that hard?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
Three months.
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
What do you want with me?
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
Grotesque... monstrous...
Not from me, surely...
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
Do it now!
What do you want from me?
And then?
I don't expect you'd understand.
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
East of Mercia?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Gump, is it?
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
What!
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Will you lead me to her?
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
And if she thinks me a liar?
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
What know you of fields of war?
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Will you chance a miss?
That's it!
It's what we'll find there worries me.
It doesn't matter.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Patience, lad.
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
Sapphire!
And did you?
No, no, no... this is different!
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
I may have said perhaps...
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
Be patient.
I'll go search for it.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Lili... I love you!
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Dead, dead, dead.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
No fear of that now.
Only that?
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Jest with me then.
And sweet?
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
And as barren of love as stone.
Be fair, Oona.
I think she's about to foal.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
The Black Baron, you say?
You've been inside?
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
It's so beautiful.
Mom said I should.
What's wrong?
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Let's shut up and not kill her.
What are you doing here?
No thanks.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
What are you talking about?
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
And if I enclosed it?
A sink?
I flushed it down the toilet.
How's your wife?
That's too long.
How old are you?
I hate this job.
For everything.
Not a shower.
I want you both to stay.
Thank you.
We're getting out of the ground today.
Why would you be there?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
I'll get your bag.
I warned you yesterday.
Why?
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
It'll be fine.
You'll have money when you work for it.
A friend of yours is here.
I might have a solution.
The gloves on the table are for you.
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
Don't.  I don't want it.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
I know.  Why?
How do you become something you're not?
What I'm not.
I'm telling you now.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
That's so weird...
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Good for you.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
I haven't been touched in years.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
Thanks for telling me.
I know there's an explanation.
Where is he?
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
Where have you been for a week?!
Why would they tow your truck?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
I don't have a phone.
Let's go.
Sam's favorite.
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
That was the truth.
I need to know.
Left you?
It's not my back that's killing me.
Not a perfect day.
Don't even...I'm there.
We should take a vacation.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
I never asked for more.
Take it off.
Hey.
Can you stay for dinner?
I don't know what I'm doing.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Not for me, it ain't.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
Yes, sir.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Here!
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
Why didn't you take it?
A loan officer?
Winston. His name's Winston.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
So?
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Forget it.
What do you want, Claude?
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
Him?
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
Hey, there's Wilkins!
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
'Course I was right. About what?
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
I'm all right.
'Preciate it. Claude.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
No problem. Oh, boy!
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
It'll be too late.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Are you offering me a bribe?
Me? Willie Long.
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
Let her go.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
You mother...
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Noon...
Urr... uggg... errr...
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
What can I do about it?
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
I think you're looking at him.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Definitely.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
Coulda been much worse.
You got it.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Should we wake him up?
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
You keep a bat under your seat?
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
What was that?
Are you dead?
Why would you be floating?
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
From my dad's side of the family.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Anything to eat?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Just the face.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Just wondered... what happens?
Well... you can't have them all.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
It has nothing to do with you.
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
No.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm going to run.
I don't have much time.
You're not going, are you?
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
I doubt it.
I won't.
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
No.
All this. All of it.
For as long as I can remember.
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
I have always been here...
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
No, no, no
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
This is our bedroom.
No. Fred hates them.
Yeah.
You know what I think?
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
We should stop seeing each other.
Andy?
Okay.
We killed him.
Alice?
Alice?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Yes, I believe so.
What happened to me?
The wife killer?
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Coming up.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
Not even close.
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
My... My head.
No, no. I want to go in.
Alice who?
What are you going to do?
Wake me up when you get home.
A videotape.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
I guess so.
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
What night?
Whatiya mean?
You really don't remember?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
Come on... get in.
Yeah.
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
Fossils.
Uh-huh.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
Good morning?
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Why, of course. Yes.
That's ridiculous.
Will you stop squawking!
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Horns? What kind of horns?
In a quandary.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Gold. You were going to?
All right.
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
They were.
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
You're startled?
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Then it's done.
Oh, dear.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't?
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Yes.
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as?
Mine?
You?
Yes.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
Dead?
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
That's what you said.
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
All right. Sorry, George.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
So you think I'm mad?
I don't need any proof.
Oh, George . . .
Yes, the little Russian girl.
Yes.
Yes, everything!
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
What was that?
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly?
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
What if he refuses?
In for what?
My name's Sondra.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I wonder.
Bump?
Struggling, why?
I was just going to.
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
Go? Where?
Please don't go.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
What the hell...
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Well this didn't.
Actually, sir--
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Kay...
We wear black.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
I taught kindergarten.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
I think that's what's happening...
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
The Pentagon.
I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
In case I need it.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
You figured what?
It's... coming.
Nothing.
What if I don't?
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
Wait-- listen--
What the hell is going on?
Where's he making his big speech?
Is it now?
Agatha...
Why?
She died?
She's still alive?
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
Right.  I know --
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
I can't even stand up --
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
Drowning.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Lara --
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
We won't let them.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
I'm not getting halo'd.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
You're kidding, that's today?
I show a cop on horseback.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Yeah?  So?
We're in motion on something.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Because it was going to fall.
Yes.
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Just a nickname.
Oh... Hi, John.
I need your help.
That's right.
They don't belong to anybody.
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Hold your breath, Dad...
Some -- somebody's father?
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
You're not gonna kill me...
The what?
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
Sean --
None of your damn business.
What?
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
How?
No, I wanna kill my boss!
We can stop him.
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Sure.  Raincheck.
Yes.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
We used to, every summer.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
I haven't seen him in two years.
But there's still the other two.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
What's 'incidentals?'
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Is it the good room?
Manhattan.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
He's okay.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's alright.
Mommy's not home?
Who's watching the baby?
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Ho's a good guy --
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
There's no touching.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
You driving her?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Ruiz tied in out there?
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Ricky's taken care of.
What?
Yeah. Sorry.
Ruiz knows about this?
You told him you liked him.
What is it?
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
No. That's cool, man.
Understand me?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
Don't be shitty.
I got no idea.
Bye.
Then why do you try to get in?
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Fuck him.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
It's not even yours.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
Don't even start.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
She was jonesing for me.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
You want us strapped, don't you?
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
Where do you get this shit?
I'll be a minute.
Fuck...
And you grew up in Manhattan?
You want your surprise?
He's on the list.
Cool. See you later.
Where do you live?
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
Does anyone want another?
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Here...
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
You're from LA, right?
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Thanks.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Who's up for a night on the town.
Bet you like that shit.
Heard where?
Solid, daddy.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
I don't want your money.
There's two guns on you.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
Are you?
Yes. Did you eat?
You're with me even when you're away.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Betty it's me. It's me.
I'm tired of praying.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Is my family here yet?
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
That's right.
Please, go ahead.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Let me do it then.
I say a lot of things.
With him?
The sentences to run concurrently.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
How long has this been going on?
And don't come back.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
You the man!
Yeah.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Are you sure?
He's bright.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
What do you want?
I don't know shit about you.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[I'm on to Juarez.]
It's a little late.
So where do we begin?
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
I show, you give me the information?
Where?
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I believe you.]
[Who's he?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[And?]
[You stole the drop.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Pinta...
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
Different door. Not far from here.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
I'm a bargain.
No.
I'm not crying.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
Yeah. Two or three.
I'm sorry.
That's not a question.
Still not a question.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
You got that right.
Never.
No.
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Planned what?
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
Our daughter.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Which one was that?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
It's her baby too, you know.
Who?
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
I don't.
I really should get home...
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Oh, I'm fine.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Please...
Nothing.
I'll wait for your call.
Nothing.
Sure.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
I'll see you around.
That's the one.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
About eight o'clock.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
That's all right, that's all right...
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
I don't wanna talk about it!
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
That's right.
Pour one for Painless.
There's only one way.
Or her figger.
I don't drink intoxicants.
Same general idea.
And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
He can't take much more time on the table.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
Call Dago Red.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
You betcher ass, General.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
I like an olive.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
I don't get it.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
Something else we have in common.
Ayuh.
I didn't mean with me.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Thanks.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
I ?wouldn't ?wish ?it ?on ?a ?maneating ?shark.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
You mean who hit who?
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
They can't do that to me!
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
Now?
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think?
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Yeah, that's the one.
I guess so. Then what happened?
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
And, Miss Mitchell桰 think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
No, no, no梩hat's your seat.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house梐nd then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and?
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor?
Wait a minute . . .
You bet I will, Ma.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers梥tart arguments.
There is no letter.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
What John Doe?
So?
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room梪nder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
I used to pitch.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Where is she?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Well?
Why梪h?
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appear梐nd in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
No, I didn't.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Did you want to see her about something important?
That's too bad.
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove梖lopped into a chair梐nd has taken out his ocarina.
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you make梐nd it's all written out for you.
Shh!
What?
I didn't see anything.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
You want me to go up with you?
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Being faxed over now.
Roper, we're into it...
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
I know.
National Marksman Competition.
It was okay.
Is there something wrong with that?
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Every couple of months, huh?
No.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
So what do I say to this guy?
I'm not good at lying.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
You're a compulsive gambler?
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
That's okay. That's his style.
Yeah, first and second.
The jockey!
How much you wanna bet?
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Only that floor.
If you did, you never showed it.
Mmm, needs a little something.
It's okay. We broke up.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
Define concern.
Your concern is heartwarming.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
I want to be put on this case.
Who's running it?
Who's running it!
Yes, I believe he has --
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
Yes.
True.  But why?
Not my problem.
Yes.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
It's his nature.
New York.
There is no --
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Try harder.
Cleaning up a mess.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
It was a test.
I know.
This.  No point to it.
Resurrection.
Speed?
Wait a second...  What time is it?
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
Yeah, right.
Stylin'!
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
WHITE TIGER!
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
What does that mean?!
... I just pray we're not too late.
I think so.
We can take these guys!
LET'S FLY!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
BULK!!
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
How about Major Moron?
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
And I ain't no nigger either!
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Poor, yeah.
Not another word.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
That ain't what your mama said.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
You're sure?
It's too late.
Why? You're the innocent one.
I'm doin' business here!
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
It'll just be a few minutes.
Who?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Come off it, Bugs.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
Never threaten me, Boss.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
They're friends of our enemy.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
That's why I'm here.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
You disrespect our tradition.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
We can operate around these guys.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Come on. Be polite.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Kill them! Kill them!
Anything!
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
I didn't say anything.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Bend over?
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that pi馻ta, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Tell me what?
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Monkeybone...!?
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
When'd you get in?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
All right. You can come.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
What?
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
We like to think so, yeah.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
Mother!
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
I can make my own decisions.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
... Manly?
So, you come here all by yourself?
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
This way?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
Yeah. Funny--
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
My friends?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Again? Good idea.
Have *you*?
Well, let's get going.
Susan? Nah!
Right now--everything I own--!
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Oh--Jim!
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Ma! Hold him!
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
For one week!
I yield.
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
No.
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
How's Amos, Ma?
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
You're a liar!
Office of--Senator Smith?
The man downstairs said number--
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Well--he's got nothing on me.
Convene?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Oh, but this one is so simple.
What's that?
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
No.
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Well, if it's all the same to you--
No!
In Terry Canyon?
Second drawer.
Not another bill?
Thanks a lot.
Don't mention it--
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Wow!
Are you drunk?
Saunders--
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
How are the pigeons?
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Then you *did* say it.
Goodnight, Senator--
Well! You don't say!
Well--I--
Yes, sir--
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
How's that, buddy?
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Susan!
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
What do you mean?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Some people like it.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Sometimes twice.
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Yes, indeedy.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Your Honor!
Yes!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Yes!!!
Look, this is my house. I'd like to?
What happened?
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
That depends on what they see.
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
You have?
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
A girl?
No. It's nothing.
We're not going out tonight.
Uh-huh.
Have lunch.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Had the boys follow us.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Shhh!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Mr. Cedar!
But your honor?
Wants to know who the heir is.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney?
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
What?
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Yeah?
Yes.
All right.
Yes.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to?
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Why should you?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Shut up!
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
We own an opera house, don't we?
Uh-huh.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
Ja.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Well, I play the tuba.
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Oh, the poet? Where?
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
South Dakota north.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Prairie? Oysters?
What two policemen?
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
You try it.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
No!  What do you want!!
What happened?
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
My approach?
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
What?!
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
My pleasure.
Do you want to come in?
Nope.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
I'd better get in there.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Yeah.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
...And?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
You're good.
That would explain it.
Martin.
What do you mean?
Could I see Sofie, please?
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Hmm.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
What?
Sorry... I'm done.
Be specific.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Yes.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
You like it?
I don't know if --
What was that?
Which show was that?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
What?
Really?
He agreed?
I understand.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Good-looking woman.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
Just you.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
English Lit.
What?
When?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Relax, I got him.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
None of the above, thank you.
You always did have more balls than brains.
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
You shall see.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Intestines.
Perhaps.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
What did you do to him!?
I am an English woman.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
What did you find? What did you see?
Really want to know?
If you call that a kiss.
Are you sure?
We're about to be shown the way.
Preparation for what?
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
And what is that?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
I have no choice.
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Still...
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Um, well, you see...
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
What?
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
I know you knew I'd know.
Head hunting.
Fantasizing... about you.
One last tweak.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
Atta, boy!
He was cute though.
The Inscrutable Six?
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Or even what it looks like.
I thought you'd never ask.
Hello?
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Get on to yourself!
Think positive.
I got it.
Against.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
It's home.
I just want to be a superhero.
Monica, where are you?
What?
I just know.
My heart died a long time ago.
But I just don't feel it.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
So you're chicken?
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
Come on.
Yes.
The Eradicators!
Hey... he's gone.
We're superheroes.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Oh hi, Mom.
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
The who?
Whatever our name is.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
It's suicide.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I think it's absolutely charming.
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
What do you have in mind?
Are you serious?
Where are they?
You could have them here by daybreak.
Properly arranged, yes.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
That is incredible.
No, sir, none at all.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Four o'clock.
It is the work of incendiaries.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Yes, I am, sir.
Do you have three francs, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
No...
And you, Junot?
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Well, you shall see.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Of course.
Promises mean nothing.
Will you be joining us, soon?
There's probably some explanation.
Why not?
I know.
Yes?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Of course, my dear.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
Yes, he has.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
And I can go free?
Yeah.
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
I'm his cousin.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Not me.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
What about the dog?
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Thanks for reminding me.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
What you mean, so?
Okay, plan B.
You already in.
I don't know yet.
What's the B-G's?
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
No, man, just wait.
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
I do.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
I'll remember.
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
Nice to meet you?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
I know.
Let it go!
Where's Craig?
Ya'll live around here?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
I don't know, Debo.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Keep pushing.
Take your car.
I got my mase.
What's the matter?
What?
Uh, yes..
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
That's right.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
Indeed.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
You wouldn't...
Good.
What's your point?
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
No, please...
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
Keep it.
Keep it.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
I don't know.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
It better be.
Shut up.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Where?
'Daddy has to go now.
Hm!
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
When'll the skiff be ready?
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Don't!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
So you ain't with the State no more?
Say what, Walt Spoon!
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
Satan.
Amen.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
She's gone to Moundsville.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
That's Daddy!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Up river.
He ain't my Dad.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
No. No.
Yes. Yes.
Mm-hm.
What secret shall I tell?
That's no secret. I'm five.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
No.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Can I have this?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
Harry, what --
How'do.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
The Drugstore?
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Haven't slept, have you?
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
What?
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
You know he's dead though, right?
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
I don't mean her --
'Anything funny' like what?
School.
Great
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Right.
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
Dead and gone.
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Nobody's gonna kill you.
Jungle man fix Jane.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
What was it like?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
I can tell you exactly.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
That's right... and we might as well face it.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
How many families live here with you?
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
We have opened a restaurant...
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Oh, yes, yes.
Good morning, Gaston.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
It's a real Paris reunion.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
What did she say about me?
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Brave... that's right.
Look for yourselves.
Just looking around.
Monsieur.
We did our best, Comrade.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
What business?
I think so too.
Oh no. No visa.
Gladly.
You might hold this for me.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Go ahead.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
I will do my best.
He takes good care of that.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
Thank you. Thank you.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
The bayonet? Did you really?
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
It's twelve o'clock.
No, that was restful. Again.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
Why?
Then you should go back to your table.
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
Anything, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
A funny story?
No. Nobody will find us.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Much happier.
No, no music.
Who cried that one?
It is their wish.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Now, Swana...
What does he say?
Huh?
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
How do you do?
No... please...
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Yes.
Has done what?
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Madame, if you...
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
I must insist that you leave.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
Go on.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
I don't understand.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Where do you eat?
My jewels?!
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
How so?
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
He wants money.
I thought the gloves were off.
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
And if I stay?
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
We were working on China.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
All right.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
Sir?
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
Let him finish, Bob.
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
What about happiness, Mother?
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
How about you?  Are you going to win?
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
The White House.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
The American people put me where I am.
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
There's no other choice.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Did you cry when he died?
Looks can be deceiving ...
Free, if you're the president.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
Mr. Nixon.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Ernie Davis.
I like jazz ...
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
No, sir ...
I know ...
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
I want a divorce.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
Are you serious?
I don't want them to love me.
Then I'll be there for you.
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
I've missed you.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
They're all your enemies?
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
You.  What' you're doing --
Lost.
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
You don't know what he thinks.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
You ain't heard from him?
Nothin'?
It could be.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Okay.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
Yes Sheriff.
I never do.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
At the gettin' place.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
You should be used to that.
Yes ma'am?
I shall return.
Hey.
You know what's goin' on?
She'll be all right.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
No me mate.
Yeah? Where am I?
You know she won't be there.
I see.
You already asked me that.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
You've lived here all your life?
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
Call it?
For what?
I didn't put nothin' up.
Sir?
Uh-huh.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
No sir, it's unusual.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
Not any way.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
No I don't have it.
I don't know. American citizens.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
You think a woman did that?!
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
What about it?
I know plenty.
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
...to see you.
This is really awkward...
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Oh, Betty --
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
He has no heartbeat!
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Man, that is love.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
How many men have I talked to?
You said in L.A., anything goes.
What? Where was he?!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Fine.
You never know who you'll see.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
Ahh... my wife's.
Fine. You got five...
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
Of what?
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
I... I don't know...
...and put them in your mouth.
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
Should I kill him now?
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
I said, 'No.' N-O.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
"Injuns?"
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
I don't know, George...
I SAID FORGET IT!
Better.
Sure.
Would you say she was ambitious?
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
David Ravell.
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
I swear to God!
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Good Lord, what do we do?
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
Where's Tommy?
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
Not that I'm aware.
Okay, Everett.
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Oh my God!
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Helluva awgazation.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Not out the other side his face, though.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
Well, we need that ring.
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
It was in his bureau.
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Buyin' nipples!
Yes, Sir.
Yes, sir.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Yeah, I know.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
I never said any of that!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
I'm doing okay, sir.
Yes, sir!
I called you Sarge.
No, sir.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
Yeah.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Come on. Let's go dance.
I got my foot on the floor.
Everything was different.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
Really?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
My kinda group!
He didn't give you much choice.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
You're better than candy.
God.
No. Is that what you want?
Why'd he do it?
That's brilliant.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
Not with me.  Not with people.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
That's right.
Remember that.
This is ridiculous...
I can't just...
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Are you gonna open the safe?
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
You know how this gotta end.
Not that one.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Adios.
Everything okay?
I don't get it.
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
Nobody leaves.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
Why?
Open the door.
That room!
Shaky?
Give me a break.
Don't though. 
I am.  I'm here.
"Titanic."
Shhh...
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Stop it.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
Oh shit Alma... you're...
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
Fuck that, we've got company...
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
You know it. Stay Black...
I don't know. Look around man.
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
We're like policing the police.
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
I don't know.
No man. Gonna walk.
I'm down.
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
Maybe...
Bullshit...
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
No.
Late summer.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
He's my father.
You couldn't have known.
Lovely.
With a lace table cloth?
My pleasure, sir.
Colonel will do.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
That one is a bit more difficult.
I consider them linked.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
Sir.
Yes, sir.
Probably.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Not yet.  What happened?
You're in no condition to ride.
It's safer if we stay together.
Oh?
Flanking riders?
She got me at a more impressionable age.
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
I stand corrected.
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Four, five miles.
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
Earned.
Remember Braddock?
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Yayyy!
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
Sure.
I think it is so, Ellie.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
Yes.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Don't worry about that.
Because it's right.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Yes.
This babe has said enough.
It's Ellie's cat.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
You don't understand--
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
That's forgotten.
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
You can't.  I can.
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
That's right.
Wait as long as you like.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
Aye, for us there is.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
Will -- you can't trust him.
Boy overboard!
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
I can't breathe.
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Yes -- yes.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
-- then we never would have met.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Me!
The trees are taller.
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
Nor did you, I noticed.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
I know.  That was for the smell.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
No.
We need to go!
That's not true.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
I'll lead them away.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes.
... No.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
My apologies, Governor.
Where did he come from?
Until he's done.
Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Considering what?
If you loved me like I loved you?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
You don't want this.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
What did he want?
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
So, I guess it worked.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Is that so?
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
Mouse?  What mouse?
Yes.
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
Three days ago it was.
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Probably the caffeine.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
Yes.
I have to!
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Certainly. Right over there.
You may go, Smythe.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance?
For what?
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Are you crazy?
Your house?
Stewart!
You're acting like a child.
Oh, shut up!
Why?
Thanks, I will.
Oh, man!
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Yeah - go on.
I'll bite. What's the catch?
Gloria Golden?
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
I bet.
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
And the rest of us are truck horses?
I didn't run away.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Yes.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
With pleasure, Madame!
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
I understand, sir.
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Yeah?
Sure.
... It's a pretty short trip.
Thanks.
Yeah. It does.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
I told you, George. I'm not going.
No I'm not.
I don't want it to go away.
No I'm not sweetie.
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
... Lover's Lane.
So.
It's better, Mary Sue.
Thank you very much.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Still doesn't make it right.
Very well ...
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
Green.
The other one?
What are you doing?
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
You--you gotta get us out of here.
Owns the hardware store.
I don't think so.
What were you doing in a library?
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
I just don't think we have the right to ...
Sure.
The pages filled in?
Honestly ... no.
Oh ... Right.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Sure ...
I like it too.
Scout?
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
Re-runs?
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
I'm going to leave now.
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Why?
Yes.
Forget about that!
Why?
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Hi.
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Yeah ... Saw you too.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Why?
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
I don't know.
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
Call me later.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
Hi, is this Jack?
This is Georgia.
Are you watching a porno movie?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
You have a girlfriend?
You sound very cute, very nice.
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
You're going to work now?
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Yeah.
No. I'm sorry.
I need help.
I don't have a girlfriend --
This is not cool.
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
They don't get opened until eight.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Yes I do.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
Are you guys hurt?
Ok.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Nothing.
...yeah...
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
This is Lena.
...I don't know what you mean....
Yeah......yeah.....
This really looks like Hawaii here.
I think maybe over a hundred.
It's ok to ask that.
I'm fine are you ok?
You're hand is bleeding.
How?
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Sorry.
......and this is confidential?
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
That was weird. I meant good.
And I'm sorry that I did that.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
Hey...Lance....can I.....
....yes.....
You should go on a trip.
Ok.
Hi.
What?
Please don't do this.
This is a bunch of bullshit.
What are you doing?
I'm serious.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
You can't just stay in your house.
Yeah but I'm serious.
When can you leave?
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Ok.
Are you sure?
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
You ready?
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
Once or twice.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
Not now, or we're both done for.
What? What've I done?
You'll hate me now, won't you?
Mustn't do that, sir.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
It's not even noon --
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
Valcour. His chair.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I know, because I felt it myself --
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Why was it you never took her by force?
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
No. It most certainly was not.
That's not our intent --
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
What could cause a tincture like this?
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Quite.
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben? I look to the future.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
I don't believe it!
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
I pray you: be succinct.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
It's tainted money, Doctor.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
I wonder sometimes.
Am I?
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
But I am That's the killer, honey.
To make pictures.
So I've been told.
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
Uh-hub.
Yeah
Don't
One . . . buys things.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You needn't use that language with me
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
I will not have this in my home.
Sir, I-
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
Huh?
He personally asked you to?
Forget it-
Telling stories.
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
The old man has his own way of doing things
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Don't do this
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Yes.
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Again.
CITIZEN KANE
Ah, it's a grand title.
Then find another theater
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
It's just that my movie is so-
Happy birthday.
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
I know what you want but it can't be done!
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
What?
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Hit me in the face.
Here's your glove.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
When?
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
So what?
Whatsa matter with you?
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Can you see it?
It's OK.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Yeah, what?
I never noticed his face.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
I am answering...
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
You did?
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Don't make no difference no more.
What friends?
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Never felt better.
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
For instance?
I was jaywalking.
I think they missed their chance with her.
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Your logic is backward.
All the things I hate.
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
Your Lisa?
A possibility.
Like an old hambone?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
She expects me to marry her.
I don't want to.
I'm not ready for marriage.
No.
She's just not the girl for me.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
You can tell that from here?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
I think it's enchanting.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
Without any future?
Something too frightful to utter.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
Thinking about Thorwald?
It doesn't make sense to me.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Inside stuff?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Too close.
How?
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
What?
What?
Stay there.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
Smashed the front door.
No--
And you dropped it?
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
I was in it.
Will you wait a minute?
Sorry.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
What's that pounding?
Plato.
In my mother's drawer.
They're still there!
I hitched.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
We know.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
All right, darling.
Good Lord!
What's that got to do with it?
Grandma?
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
And your folks didn't understand?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Listen--
Won't mother be proud.
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
See, we're very modern.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
Hi.
Okay.
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
You said you'd call my father.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
What are you doing here?!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
No, baby. He wants me.
To all those cons...
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
No, hey, I like your coat --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Tell me again.
Then he shoulda signed his name.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Nick...
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
Nick, I love you --
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
They're truck drivers.
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
Nick, the ice is --
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
Nick, what are you talking about?
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
The hell I can't.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
I shared his cell!
Yes!
I never worked at no casino.
She says a lot of things.
Hey.
I don't know.
Christmas... Eve...
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
No, Gabriel... no...
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
'Tis the season, convict.
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
And where they hide the real money.
I don't steal any --
OPEN IT!!!
GO!!!
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Fuckin' freezing.
Five years. Since it opened.
How do we do that?
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
Merlin, I didn't know --
It's a roach, guy --
Oh, man --
Ain't there yet.
I'm just talking.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
YOU TELL HER!
What? No...
There is no other table --
I'M NOT NICK!
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Was he all pissed off?
How do you know all this?
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
This better not be some Freddy joke.
How can you tell?
Yeah.
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
What for?
You can do some crazy things with it.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Like hell I am.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
Don't ask me that.
Mr. Pink.
You do?
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You didn't ask.
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
I'm okay.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
Lie back down, and try to -
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Why not?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
That was the plan, we meet here.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
We can't take him to a hospital.
This is what he was doin'.
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
You can stay here if you like.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
Will she be dark or fair?
Why?
I haven't got the job yet.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
A little hot.
All right. I'll tell you.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
Finished, son?
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
Three men on matched roans?
Nobody asked you to.
I said I didn't care.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
I like it.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Go ahead.
They went on like I told you.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
They shouldn't have done that.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
He certainly could. About a month.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Would they be good to eat?
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Oh, sure.
I think he wants me.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Hello Ray.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Okay.
Yeah.
It looks like the furnace.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Great!!!
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
I don't care. You pick.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Not in a thousand years.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
I don't need your help.
I'll go.
Alright, let's take a vote...
My child, you're alive!
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Are these all the subjects?
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
What's this?
In about fifteen minutes.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Hi.
Just a little experiment.
And sexy.
Thanks, handyman.
My help?
How is she?
Then let us prepare.
What?
My holy water.
Dog, you look hot.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
It says, "Ray."
Aww. Cool. Dude.
No more violence... No more violence...
MURDERED?!!
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
Is there a killer loose?
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
This is so silly. 
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
What a mess.
Yes, I did.
...People who don't mind their own business.
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
I beg your pardon?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
It's not fair!!
I certainly was not!
Yes, I was.
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Bon Appetit!
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
You forgot something...
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Can we go there now?
Drink.
Yes.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
How much have you got?
I'll try there.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
No. She asked about the trademark.
Yes.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
I'd like that.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -?
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
I know 棗 I shouldn't have told you?
I don't know.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Why wait?
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I don't know.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
But it's a small room, Jason.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -?it fits in with what I saw -?she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
I keep telling myself that.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything 棗 and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
No. She's no longer under my care.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
She's not been here for a long time.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Why
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Nine years.
Who's Elizabeth?
What's the first?
I feel like they do.
Kids? What about them?
Do you want me to?
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
You're in therapy?
You had sex with you therapist?
Yes.
She said it on her tape.
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
Don't you want to make one?
It won't. Are you ready?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Sometimes. Afterward.
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Yes.
Do you want me to stop?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Why?
Yes.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
Yes.
No.
You said you weren't always impotent.
So you have had sex.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
What was the problem?
How come?
But I don't understand --
No.
Yes.
I don't know.
Why not?
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
I want out of this marriage.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Yes.
He does.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Yes.
Not really.
Yes.
Why?
He doesn't have a phone.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Let me talk to him first.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Why did you do that?
But why did you want to?
Did he touch you?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
What is it?
Nope.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Talking.
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Is that what he tells you?
I can't talk you into it?
Why?
I did.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
In here!!
Cynthia. John.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
She's there? What's she doing there?
Nothing wrong with trying.
What's so stupid about it?
I wish you hadn't done that.
God, you... you're mean.
It'll just be me.
No.  You said three-fifty?
You were prying before?
Really. How'd it go?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Goddamit...
Brian Kirkland, please.
John Millaney.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
NIGHT NIGHT
A wreck.
I got it!  I got it!!!
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Everything's free there.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
...closed?
Indulge?
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
That doesn't make sense.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
YOUNG BLOOD
YOUNG BLOOD
Me?
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Flavors!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
No.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Huh.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Say, is Maya working?
Stephanie.
Oh yeah.
Good. How're you?
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
That's on us.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Maybe. Recognize this?
No, we're paying for the wine.
Well, in that case...
Yeah, Conundrum.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
I'm working on it.
Now we're talking.
When do we get to drink it?
If that's what feels right.
Pour us a couple.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
So what's the plan today?
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Miles.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
With Maya?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Shut up. Shut your face.
Count me out.
Okay! Jesus!
What?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Nope.
Thanks, Jack.
Could be anything.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
What's happening?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
It's private.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Yeah.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
Uh-huh.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
You need a new car anyway.
Maya, how are you?
The Windmill.
That's what I'm having.
How long have you been into wine?
"The Day After Yesterday."
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Sure.
Good. So did I.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Victoria.
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
About a year.
Both.
I told you I need a drink.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
Don't touch him.
You don't even know what that word means.
It tastes funny.
You love walks.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Curse and stuff.
You want him coming in the house next time?
Yes it was.
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
Ray Reddy's house.
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
Me too.
I'm close.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
Six months.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Pinned? What does that mean?
You'll lose the signal!
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
No money, eh?
...And you had to kill him?
Sure.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Where's Jake?
Right.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
Yeah... that must have been it.
This is a brutal land.
My name is Emmett.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
And they were two of them. Look --
No, Leavenworth.
Where's Turley?
It's a town...
I expect.
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
What's that?
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
What now?
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
Really?
That ain't right.
It's none of your business.
Rae, I need help.
Good luck, Mal.
Lucky.
Where's Emmett now?
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
I just got to town.
It is that.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
What's she got to do with it?
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
So-called?
Who's the owner?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Of course.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Okay -- for you.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
I don't know if that's going to happen.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
If it's on the page...
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
What about it?
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Viktor, you should have said something.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
No.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Thank you.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
Impossible.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Not if I don't let her.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Hello, is this Elaine?
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
It was a great show, Dad...
Just a minute.
Because obviously she existed, right?
Of course.
... so much like her?
Is that a problem?
Please put your clothes on
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
It was more in passing.
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
How did the wall get there?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I was misquoted.
I've seen them all before.
You do?
I'm already dead.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Hello, sweetheart.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
Why?
I do.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
-- I bet you have.
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Dark?
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
Good.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I didn't leave you.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
Dr. Crowe.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
You mean aneurysm.
He your best buddy?
You hate him?
I don't tell her a thing.
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Yeah. Sorry.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Upset words.
Yes.
Never mind.
Yes.
I don't know.
Yes.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
You do?
I definitely won't.
Standing next to my window.
They want me to do things for them.
They used to hang people here.
Stop looking at me.
It's our pleasure.
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Chicken blood on the crops.
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Who? Us?!
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
About what?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Mmmm -- so can I...
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
It's you. You and your father.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Never.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Like what?
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
That's not funny.
Just checking out the lights.
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Starla, it ain't --
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Hey, look!
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
Your what?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
What do you think?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Shoot.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
You could've asked.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Bandit II?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Absolutely.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
That's me.
Another time.
How'd you know?
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
Go.
Six. Got it.
Because they said it couldn't be done.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Save it. We got a long haul.
What's your twenty?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
What's your twenty?
I ran into complications.
We're gone.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
I'm here.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
That's the point, Dickey.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
What kind of personnel?
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Of course. Yes.
Maybe.
And a very bad gamble.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
And threw us into the lake.
Yeah, why.
...About what?
That's not possible. I told you.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
I thought Heller was a double op?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
-- will be handled back in --
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
...He does now...
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
-- okay, g'head --
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
A million flat.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
Yes.
Why did you agree to come here?
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
Whose side are you on?
Where's Sartorius?
That depends.
I don't know.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
What is it?
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Not necessarily.
No.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
You didn't look very happy.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What kind of look?
You don't know?
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
Yes.  Yes.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
You... she said I didn't love her.
It's all right.
I'm disgusting.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
I never said I didn't.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Why do you say that?
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I'll come with you.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Could be, I guess.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
What do you want?
Claire, will you calm down?
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Not exactly.
I don't know.
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
I know.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Just putting in an appearance then.
... I don't want to talk about it...
Claire...
Absolutely.
Why?
I think -- she's crazy.
I might stop you.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
She bought it.
I'll be right up.
You heard me.
No.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Call a cruiser!
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
Ever shot anyone?
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I'll prove it!
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
We're gonna pass the street.
So, what are you doing tonight?
I don't think she can sing, either.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Harry?
Can I get a word in edgewise?
How about tomorrow?
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
He knew.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
I've gotta study.
Hi, Adele.
I'm sure you kept warm.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
I'm here...
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Any sign of our friend?
Precise equipment?such as waldos?
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Aunt May, what happened?
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
Really, Professor, I--
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
I don't know anymore.
Who is it?
Yeah. Security.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
I'll call the whole pot.
How much more do we have to take from him?
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
Sefton!
Yeah.
It's on me.
Let's!
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
Abfuehren!
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
Stop it, Harry!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
You're teasing me again!
Where'd that come from?
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
She'll never forgive me!
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
What do they always say?
It's not good for you, Animal.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
You want to go?
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Yes, sir.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
I called it the last time, didn't I?
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
What's the decoy?
Give this to Joey, will you?
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Give me the radio.
Ich weiss alles.
Here. Take them.
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Russian women prisoners?
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Just don't drool on it.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
Agreed.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Where are the deflector relays?
I always do.
No, I didn't know that.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
The thought had crossed my mind.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
Aye, sir.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
... Fascinating.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
... Or <u>who</u>.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
Not exactly.
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
Goodbye, David.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
The ship... Out of danger...?
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Fire, Mr. Scott!
About a dozen officers and men.
Go, Sulu!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Torpedoes coming in -- !
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.

Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Success, my lord.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
And who am I hiding from?
How can you think of food at a time like this?
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
Maybe...
Mother, go back!
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
But we can't just sit here -- !
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
What's the matter -- ?
Never mind! Hurry!
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
How soon --
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
Is that what you came here to say?
Let them eat static.
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Inoperative.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
He'll die -- !
Admiral, this is Spock.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
How far?
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
Aye sir --
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
The ship -- out of danger?
Yes, sir.
Because... there was no way to win.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
Take the test again.
There is no such regulation.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
All stop, sir.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Aye, sir --
Stop engines.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Gillian --
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
What do you mean?
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
... My God...
Reading the patient's vital signs.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
Shields, aye.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Go ahead.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
What do you mean now?
What's what?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
I see.
Exaggerate.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
How will playing cards help?
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
I will, Admiral.
... Aye sir...?
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Aye, sir!
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Two?
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
What's the rush?
You're what?
Really?
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
How about a passive radiation scan?
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
I don't know.
Another time.
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
Understood.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
Recommendations?
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
Do you have everything you need from command?
Fail-safe?
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
On screen.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
Remind me to lodge a protest...
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Commander Riker...
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
We're not going anywhere.
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
No, sir...
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
Say the greeting again...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Good question.
No children?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Activating injector assembly.
Absolutely.
Yes...
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
I believe so.
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
I'm on it...
Active.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
The invasion plans.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
You're lying.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
Steady as she goes.
Go to manual.
Aye, sir.
Worf... torpedo... now!
What?
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
I'll keep that in mind.
Understood!
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
Riker here.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
I wish I knew. Uhura?
Can you - ?
No way.  You see this?
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
We were until your torpedoes!
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
That's a comfort...
I'm not sure how to take that.
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
Who else?
But if she's cloaked...
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
We must do this again soon.
Kill him! He's the one!!
He's got it.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Candidate for what?
Right -
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
You hear that?
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
They're dying.
I am uncertain.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
What peace conference?
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
We've been ordered to -
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
I think  not.
This one can.
Yes, sir.
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
You are me.
I am in a room with lights.
No. Can I move now?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
I can see that.
Good work. The download?
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Do you have a name, sir?
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
I know how he thinks.
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
No!
You sick bastard!
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
What do we know about the planet?
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
I'll take care of it, sir.

A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Won抰 do what, Mister Worf?
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
On screen.
Aye, sir
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
Praetor Shinzon. We抮e not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Yes.
You know I do.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
What happened?
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
I know.
In time.
Why am I here?
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
I am.
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Yes, Praetor.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
A matter of hours now.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
I came this far alone ...
I have a purpose.
I don't want to scare them away.
Probably kids.
I don't think so... 
How much are your rooms?
It's still the full price.
Eh... yes.
No.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
You're not hearing me.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Okay...
Watch it. They're coming out.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
Which way do you want to go?
Coupons.
Pancakes.
X...
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
No gas.
I am...
Closed.
I know.
My... husband.
Shit?
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
No.
Candy.
I do not understand.
Why?
Why?
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
But I speak English.
I do not speak English.
Yes.
The car will stop?
Can I have the gun?
Goodbye.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
He will.
Yes.
Yes. Sing some more.
On the radio they say it's good.
No. Get in.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
Come on.
I must meet my ship.
I can't stay on this planet.
You promised.
I gave you a baby last night.
Yes.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
I understand.
If you want to keep it, you can.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
I must go.
I will.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Get Fox.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
No.
I wouldn't think so.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
No problem.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
No, Lenny.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Can't do it.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Tell me.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
Okay... what about Strickland?
Jesus!
That's pretty much the way it happened.
You bet.  Did you like it?
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
What?
Who was just here?
What clip?  What was it?
She never gave me a tape.
Strickland.
Sleaze to peddle.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
She still loves me.
She's my destiny.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
So that gives you something.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
It's not your fault.
But that doesn't add, does it.
This tie doesn't go with blue!
Fire's out, isn't it?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
I'm not going.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
You never told me.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
Take the tape to the cops.
You really want that on your head?
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
No, sir.
That's right, Jan.
You're thinking...?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
What's the bad news?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You must travel a lot, huh?
Not bad, huh?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Maybe cause he's smart.
What?
This better be important.
Who?
From the grave?
Then why do I still have a badge?
How long ago?
Collected shoes too?
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
I was visiting an old college friend.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
How long have you been downtown?
Not especially.
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
And one other thing.
Sex.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
We did find these, however.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
You did.
Oh.
Not the way I can.
Jaime? Where are you?
And you're working with him?
Yeah, of course.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
I'll be back.
Yes.
He's moved on to TV.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
I already have an employer.
Maybe you should back off.
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[What does the file say?]
So you're the new meat?
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
I know, I know.
I don't know about that.
It didn't feel that way.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
No. Stop, come on.
...maybe...
Hi.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Oh. You know.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...and even then...
What else is going on?
No.
...Four days..?
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Sorry?
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
I would love to see you again sometime.
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...The red piece of shit over there...
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What'd you get?
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Well, let's hit that party.
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
What's the point?
You always know the right thing to say.
Make someone bleed.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
So, what? Eleven?
...He's derivative...
Not well.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Hang on, Voltaire.
S'up Trent?
I don't know...
What Vegas?
I'm not going to Vegas.
She smiled baby.
Did she, or did she not smile?
You think they're watching?
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
She thought you were money.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
What?!?
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Yeah. You met him once.
What?
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
They're a finesse team...
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
...It's on.
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...it's definitely on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Be smart about it.
Our little baby's growing up...
Good.  He never doubted you.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
You have to answer for Santino.
Barzini.
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
The gun will be there.
We gotta move...
How bad will it be?
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
You understand him better than anyone.
Should I bring him in.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
Yes.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
For bravery.
No.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
Yes.
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
We're all tired...
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
Can you do it Mike?
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Michael...
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
And what do you want for Christmas?
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
I'm thinking about it.
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
Please say it.
OK. 
Don't ask me.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
The kid's right.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
Probably a year...
I do renounce them.
I do wish to be baptized.
Just be patient.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
What are you doing in Mongi?
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Okay, darling.
Oh, it was.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
No, still here.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
What?
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
What club?
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
So tell me.
Tom, I don't love you.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
What are you doing?
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Frances?
I'm fine.
What about Cortina?
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Dickie did it.
Get on. I'll take you to him.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
Why? When?
I don't believe you.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Excuse me?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
How did you know that?
Is Freddie in Rome?
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
Hello Meredith.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
You try. You try talking to her.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Was who Meredith?
Well that would be even better gossip.
Postmortem?
Even your fianc閑...?
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fianc閑?
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
You have, yes.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
I know. I could have picked you up.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I bought a couple of tickets.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
This is gotta be a game, right?
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
Awh, come off it, Pal.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
You said that?
And what happened?
For a fee.
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
You carry a piece? You need one?
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
Oh, come off it, man.
Pittsburgh.
Huh?
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
How's your driving record?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Why do you ask?
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Slow.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Things got ya down?
Neither do I, I guess.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You know how I feel about what you do.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
Wrong.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
What's that?  Mason?
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Okay.  What's the second thing?
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
I had it, a minute ago...
You look... different.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Why me?
I'm  fine.  Really.  
Oh...
What?
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Have you got a cigarette?
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Ben, when's Delly due back?
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
Shhhhhh.
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Good to meet you.  Again.
Thanks.
When did I leave?
Who... are they?
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Vultures...
What.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Then I'll call you a cab.
Pete...
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
We live in a theater?
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
I was decorated.
Exactly.
So, it is a blacklist.
No thanks.
What do you mean?
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
When was that?
No, I...
No.
Oh.
The customers?  I don't know...
I thought you...
What exactly did you hear?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
Lovebirds.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
All right. 
How'd you happen to come here?
When was this?
A trifle.
Because she was afraid.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
That's up to you.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
Just listen to them!
I know.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
I don't know, honey.
I think they'll be all right, honey.
The little Brenner girl.
Try my best.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
The little Brenner girl?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
What happened?
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
But they'll be back.
No, not exactly.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Not by the thousands.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
I'm awfully sorry.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Are they moulting now?
How can you tell?
Ahhh, but I know you.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
What for?
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Famished.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
No.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
It is for me.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
And Fridays? What do you do then?
I'll get it.
Hear, hear!
Don't let's take any chances.
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Almost two a.m.
Yes.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
I have no idea.
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
How?
That would hardly be possible.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Can't you please finish your drink?
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Ask this one favor --
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
Aye.
I've heard of it.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Excuse me.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
I remember her.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
No.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
Not yet.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
I want it --
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
A doctor?
I am the best man for the job.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I take no gifts from you.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
I've drunk enough tonight.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
I come from Lisbon.
Aye --
Where are they?
You're wrong.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
Dream on.
Yeah. I sure will.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Keep that thing away from me.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
I don't know you, man.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
He didn't kill her.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
So you're going to kill him?
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
Erin. I'll always be with you.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
About 250 million of your miles.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
You still haven't answered my question.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Come on in.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
I feel different right now.
Naturally I think so.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Goodnight, my dear.
What time is it?
It won't work.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
I -- I thought you were--
He'll have you -- and Tom.
I'd give you a very good price.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
Can't stand light?
Time to activate Plan B.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
The Prince of Darkness.
They're gonna book us.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Yeah.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
What?
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
You have a T.V.?
Whatcha doin' over here?
Did we have a date tonight?
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
I like Michael.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Smells like something died.
Soon.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
Okay.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Because I love you...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Save Laddie first.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.  On the phone.
Don't bother.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Let's load 'em.
Dogs don't eat each other.
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Finish what?
I don't know who to trust.
Watch Clark.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Have you come across Fuchs?
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Hell no.
You buy any of this, Blair?
We got morphine, don't we.
Then I'll have to kill you.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
All in Norwegian.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Nothing we can do about that.
In this weather?
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
A couple of hours.
After all this mess.
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
I ain't going with Sanchez.
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Why?
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
Calm down and get in your position.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
So what do you make of it?
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
But you're only a mud carrier.
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Can you show us where they live?
Kalen... hold on a minute.
It was meant to.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Vox...
They survived above.  Became what they are.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
No...
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
You know I can't.
Sorry... I was distracted.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Let them.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
How romantic...
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
I'm glad.
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
Mm.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
More than 800,000 years.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Or mud carriers.
What are you?
How do you decide?
You lost someone.
Someone you loved very much.
Is it?
So you can use it now?
Go back to your own time?
Mara --
Mara...?
Do you have it?!
I see.
Exactly correct, sir.
New Yorkers.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
I suppose so.
And you've no idea where he went?
I'm fine.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
That's too bad.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
He didn't either.
I never touched your father! I swear!
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
No, it hasn't.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
[Beat] What?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
What?
Yes.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
No, he didn't.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
I still don't either, even after all these years.
You're not crazy.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
I could try to...make it stop.
I never knew my father. Did you?
[Beat] I don't know.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
It doesn't look all that different.
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
Who told you this?
Don't you go to jail for that?
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
Why?
So what am I supposed to do?
Is it true?
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
You girls are in some hot water.
How are things goin' out there?
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
Oh, great.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
A regular outlaw.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Christ, sure... yes!
Not yet.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
It's nothin' like that.
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Maybe.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Which part?
Yes.
So this is all my fault, is it.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
I don't know.  I won't be.
I won't wait up.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
What happened?
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Why not?!
You're right.
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
You know those little dogs you see people with?
I can see that.
Sorry!
Just asking.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Yes, Thelma?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
We can change our names.
You too, sweetie, the best.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
Where?!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
It's grand!
What are you talkin' about?
Go?
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Hi there!  You alright?
Fresno.
What?
The thing's kind of heavy.
So you admit it?
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
Loser? You?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
What?
Huh? But why did Healy?
Uh-huh.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Call you back.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
You found my car?!
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
Ahh.
No thanks.
I already know it, Mary.
It's right there on your golf bag.
What's that?
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Deco.
-- Love story of our time.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Come on, what were you going to say?
Huh... that's strange.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Who the hell's Woogie?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
You don't buy what?
Oh my.
Do what?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
You're a sick man, you know that?
What?
You mean him.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
How'd you manage that one?
Fucking sickening.
Four.
I never said that.
You were following us?
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Where would I have seen your work?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Oh yeah.
Who's that?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Really? I never got a message.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Yeah?
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
All right, let's go.
Yeah, sure.
Toy poodle!
You're Woogie?
What?! No please, sir --
I wasn't trying --
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Huh...?
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
What are you doing?
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
What if I can't?
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
An invasion...
Still heading for Cuba.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
Yeah.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Hey. Nice tie.
Again. Figures, man.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
How'd you know?
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Why?
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
His spiritual mother...
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
He also said "listen to the water."
I don't see the connection.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Ray --
Cuz you're a cop.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
We're going for The Stronghold.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Go ahead, Ray.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
How the hell do you know?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
It's not that.
I'm with someone.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Where were you?
Apology acknowledged.
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
What are you talking about?
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
Used to what?
I'm starting to sense that now.
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
About as much as they think about killing me.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Winston Churchill.
I'm still second best.
What?
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
That's up to you.
Your watch.
Who's gonna win?
How could you?
Right on the flight line?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
You.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
What?  What is it?
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
NO. NO GOOD.
Saving them some paperwork.
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
280, 290, 300 knots.
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Who's your pilot?
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
Time to go.
Skipper, you can't do this!
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
SHIT!!
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
Figured out what?
I think I can work it out on my own.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
Me?
Sir?
Yes sir!
The wings..
Yes sir.
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
No bother.
I never heard that.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Who are you?
Thank you.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
I am Quaid.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
No, sir.
What is it?
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Why not?
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
Brunette.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
At Rekall.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
That's right.
Arrest that woman!
O.K., everybody pull out!
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Well don't.
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
You went to Rekall, remember?
Let me buy you a drink.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
What is it?
Come on!
How did I get in this taxi?!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
You know I do.
Just think about it.
Bye.
Oh God, Doug.
I'm here at Rekall.
Doug, don't!
How real does it seem?
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
I guess he didn't.
What are you talking about?
Hauser left me a note.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
I saw them.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
The one in the mine!
Aliens built it.
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
You can't fight'em that way...
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Well, who put you two in charge?
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Why?
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
That's the plan.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Great.  Thank you.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Oh shit!
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
Right.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Not yet, not yet...
Civil?  I'm civil.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
What?
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
You bet.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
God, what a stink!
Around here?  Why would they?
Let's assume that it is.
It does.
True.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Not necessarily...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
No. No...
Of course.
I specialize, Roger...
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
What, the lunatic who --
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
1530 Rivington Street.
But what?
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
What's Art Esparza?
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
...For ten years, now.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
Want to tell me what went down here?
"Painted"?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
That's right.
Calls for speculation.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
No? Then what did he say?
-- Eddie told you?
-- What trial?
That's right.
-- Roger --
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
Yeah, we do some of that.
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Albert.
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
Blonde.
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Oh.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
What?
Teresa Banks.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Someone else has it now.
Where's Hap?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
What do you mean?
How do you figure?
What do you mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
That's what I heard.
That's good.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
Faulty wiring.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Cause I like it.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
Who would do that?
Maybe.
What does Bob say?
No... No...
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
What? She asked about my father?
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Let's go all the way.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
You know it and I know it.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
See what?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Sure you do, it's good for you.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Stay away from me.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
Who am I?
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
As if I didn't know.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
I'm fine.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
And no one will know the truth.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
It's a crime.
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
I know of him.
Through, through his book.
Objection.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Huh!
Nothing further, your Honor.
Yes.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Yes!
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
...I made a reservation at...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
I understand.
...that's perfectly all right.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes.
Yes.
Why is that?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
...things change.
That happens.
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
What...?
I've got to work.
You're going to stay here...?
What is that to you...?
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Mr. Alito, please.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Let me talk to Mickey.
Missus...
Nothing happened.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
...fifty thousand dollars?
...I understand...
...I understand...
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Admittance form is wrong.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She did?
In New York?
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
We, we were rather busy...
How'm I doing so far?
Should I?
All right - I've seen enough!
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
It's gone now.
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
It was...  ...one of them!
It might give us something.
Right.
So is the town, I notice!
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
Sort of a trial balloon.
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Like what?
No...
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Say how they find their way back home.
The mean old man with the claws.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
What are you talking about?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Coffee'd be nice.
Black's fine.
I am about this.
I can take it.
I haven't forgotten.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Yeah.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
It was a bad dream...
Shut up, Phil.
What's the difference?
I gotta go.
Fine.
Do what?
How do you know?  They might.
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Sir...?
He killed the dolphin.
They have every right Chuck.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Twice.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
I can take care of myself.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
You do?
You're officer of the watch, George.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Like you'd know what to do with one.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
It seems we're short on singers.
Outer.
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
What?
About anything.
Son of a bitch!!
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
I don't know...
I can't.
What makes you so sure it was one?
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
It wasn't hard.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
No.  I didn't.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Why? He's right in the groove.
This be it?
Well... Yeah - okay.
Get out.
You was in the Marines, huh?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Used to.
Thanks.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
Hasta siempre.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
See ya downstairs.
And?
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Didn't he say somethin'?
No, he picked me up.
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Yeah?
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
She got me an abortion...
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
You mean like pedal pushers?
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Come look at this.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
It's just another case, Sailor.
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
You certain?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
I'm goin'.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
You think she's gonna make it?
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
The only one.
Yeah?
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Oughta make 'em happy.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Got any plans?
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Santos... It isn't.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Yes.
Santos... I can't...
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Well?...
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
How are you, Crabtree?
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
She left me. Crabs.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
No. Not yet he isn't.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
So what's the problem?
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
Find the jacket.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
...we find the jacket.
Excuse me?
Her dog, yes.
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
Stop calling me Vernon.
Yea?
...You carry firearms.
A little.
It's colder in there.
Heaven?
Like the lady herself.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Yea, James.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Is he all right?
I put you on the floor.
But James. I mean... How long?
Hm.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
The hell I am.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
In a minute. Get us a table.
I eat.
Okay.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Oh. Well. I...
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
Hm.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Yes.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Is the thing -- is it over?
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
You got me.
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I think I might have.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
I said it didn't sound like you.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
Oh?
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
Why yes. How did you know?
I'm your man.
What's that?
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
I... I...
Taking the long way home.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
Why did you come here, Grady?
Give me a break, Grady.
The perpetrator.
No, I'm going ho --
Just a few then. The big ones.
I doubt it, darling.
No shit.
How old is Anna?
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
You don't have to tell me this.
Their sound is quite musical.
It's a bright sound.
I have friends.
Robin.
Cop.
Have a seat.
I could get a search warrant.
Okay.
What?
I fell asleep.
No.
What?
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I could take you downtown.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
I count my blessings.
'Fraid not.
It gives me headaches.
What?
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Are you sure?
I don't mind.
That was a joke.
A diary?
Of course.
Reflect.
Forget it.
I don't.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
I don't know.
That's my answer.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I don't see --
In my bed too.
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
Yes.
I was six years old!
It was a small house.
Are you okay?
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
I thought you were a dyke.
What do you think?
Yeah, they could.
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
What for?
Hi.
Because I like you.
What?
Walter.
No. Never again.
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
Sounds like a special guy.
I was always the one seduced.
Nothing. It's over.
What odds?
Which brother did this?
You never asked them about it?
Who doesn't?
Nothing.
Yeah.
Where're you?
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
I'm switching off now.
Not for long.
That must be it.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
I don't know, look around.
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Hi, lady.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Who then?
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Let's go, guys.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Missed what?
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
She'll wait.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
Four or five days.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
More so than the shark?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
No.
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
Yes, maybe that is better.
Yes.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
But then when will we see each other?
And what about you?
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
And why did you drop them?
Why?
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Why?
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
What do you mean by sensible?
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
To the shark.
It couldn't be any clearer.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
We'll try again.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Is that possible?
Is that far from here?
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
Who tells you these things?
That's not what he meant.
Yes Mother.
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
I burnt them.
They were stained.
It's not my time of month.
I don't know... I don't know...
Love.
In the confessional.
And then what?
Where did the baby come from?
Where'd it come from before that?
Martha Louise Livingston.
No.
Does it bother you?
No, but I can never tell her that.
I could never be a mother.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
A mistake...
Not my fault.
She watches... she listens.
She...
Yes.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
And then...
Yes.
Doctor Livingston.
Of what?
Because I was afraid.
Because I wasn't worthy.
She made me promise not to.
We went to chapel for vespers.
What else?
What do you do?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Yes.
Yes.
And the passage to the barn?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Agnes who did you see?
Agnes, who did this to you?
Sister...
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
If I find anything I'll call you.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Who are you?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
No-one.
I haven't a clue.
None as far as I know.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
That possibility never occurred to you?
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
What?
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
Then help her.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
What is it?
What sheets?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
I'd love one.
All right?
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Saint Peter?
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
Who is he?
Well give me a reasonable explanation
This is insane.
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Is it because she's a nun?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
That's a lie.
Then she's a liar.
What happened to the baby?
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
We'd be thrown out.
Shurrup!
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
They'll be here.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
I'll have a bash.
Have I said something amiss?
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Ah well. Eh, look!
You crawler.
We do.
Is he?
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Follow your impulse.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Is it ... is it, really?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Yes.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Parading?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
What's that mean?
Oh ... I dunno.
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
I'm not wrong.
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
What?
Every morning.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
Here, Pauly.
For Ringo.
Hiding.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
He's got you worried, then?
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Like what?
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
You needn't bother.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
Well you're not going.
We were going to do it.
Oink! Oink!
Hi, our lot!
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Y'what?
Don't exaggerate.
Aren't we ...
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
But John hasn't got any.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Get knotted!
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
A proper Aborigine.
Is that you, Roby?
Kill drive engines.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
That's what I'm going to do.
Take a look.
What is it, I can't --
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
Play it for us, please.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Has the hull been breached?
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
The water will still recycle.
No, I don't want us separated.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
It wouldn't come.
Good!  That's good!
Should we go outside and bring him in?
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
I'm trying.
We're not going anywhere.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
Is it armed?
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
What is it?
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Well, it's finally happened.
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
Found what?
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Oh well... you know me.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Is that its mouth?
Up one kilometer, Jay.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Food-storage room!
Let's be democratic.
By eating our food supplies.
What's that supposed to mean?
So the next step should be --
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
Yeah... I forgot.
Here, carry these.
Sure.
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Oh man...
We're what!?
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
And?
No, but I got something that might interest you.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
Nooooo!
Has anybody talked to them?
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
What?
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
Uh-huh.
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Want some?
Hold on...
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
What can I do?
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
Phoebe.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
Eddie...
I believe I will.
Just some coffee.
It wasn't meant to be.
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
She never proved anything, not a thing!
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
No-no-no...
Yes, Addison.
You can have one at Max's.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
You were there? At the play - last night?
Margo.
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
We have that in common.
Amen.
Of course I knew.
How nice.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
That's nice.
As of this moment you're six years old...
Call me when you get in...
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
Sing it?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
How is Eve? Okay?
I love you...
What?
It won't play.
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
So full of meaning, fire and music!
Who?
What a body, what a voice.
I'm trying terribly hard.
Here we go...
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Hear, hear...
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
You didn't have to tell me.
Of course not.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
You're quite a girl.
See you home...
Well?
Night an' day.
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
Miss Harrington...
I - I guess I fell asleep.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
They certainly don't waste much time.
I don't intend to be.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
I wish I could believe that.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
'Remembrance'.
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
Why not?
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
They're your fans, your audience-
The heave-ho.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Three or four miles...
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
What is?
I'm beginning to catch up.
Now just a minute-
Such as?
What are you going to wear?
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Where is she?
You'd have been proud of her.
She was a revelation...
That's beside the point.
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
Too bad.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
But that was the fourth straight time.
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
Answer my question!
I didn't hear you.
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
Yeah?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
--you do?--with access to records?
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
You're not a kid anymore.
Facts or theory?
You voted for him.
Go on, go on--
--we will--
You want me to be the bastard.
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
It's nothing personal, though. 
So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
Night.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
--yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
This?  Naw...
Any idea what he did?
You can't.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I know where Dwight works.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--that was awhile ago--
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
...No... never in so many words...
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- 
Electronic surveillance.
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
I have nothing more to say.
Where?  What do you mean, where?
...check...?
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Mitchell knew then.
--yes, yes, what is it?
James McCord.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
I think so.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
No, none of those.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Thanks coach.
Sure.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Pardon me?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yep.
Why is this?
Charming.
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
You can call me Oz.
Forget it.
Neither will I.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
You can't sing at the competition.
Then don't.
Yeah right.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
But that one time --
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
I do, baby, I do.
Uh...
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Right.  That gives us...
Just in time.
Holy shit!
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
You fuckin' rule!
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
So do I, Kev.
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
Just a second!
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
No...I know the perfect time...
I want to hear you say it.
I love you.
Ready for what?
What's that?
Once, in church, dude.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
I don't care.
Stifler!!
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Uh huh.
Uhh! Would you die already!
Also like sex with my wife.
Yeah. Apparently.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Andy! No!
A cure?
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
Yeah. French fries...
Fuck me...
What...?
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
Well, they are French.
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
And you call me a moron...
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Looks like he lied to you too.
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
Sort of...
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
How well did, er, do you know him?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
Double merde.
How to read.
I'm not sure but look. . .
Then come find me.
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
You must have.
Yes, your highness.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
I was all out of dynamite!
Why?
You shouldn't have pushed us!
It's not you - it's the dress!
Sad?
I'm glad you	did too.
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
Is it? Is this what you want?
Yes, you do. You do.
I cursed then all!
Bartok... a question.
He's her?
Pray he's color-blind...
Rasputin!
No. Empress, you --
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
M'mm.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Yes.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Yeah? Allison what?
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Tsch.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Me? Oh, downtown!
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Nice car.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
You sure?
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
As Balzac said...
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
U-huh.
I dunno.
You don't want me to live with you?
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
I didn't follow you!
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
David? You call your teacher David?
Yeah?
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
M'hm.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
It was just great!
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Thing?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Yeah.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
You're mad, aren't you?
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
I thought just earplugs.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Commentary.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
Don't get upset!
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I have a headache.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
It's a narrow view.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
Max, I've got a hit series.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't know, I mean, I-
His wife has diabetes!
She was stealing.
Who's persecuting? She stole!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
No.
You think so? Do you really?
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
I don't know. I don't know.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Absolutely.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
She's got great tits.
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
What?
He's allergic.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
I love her too, Joe.
Damn straight.
Count on it.
Sally?
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Nice to meet you.
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Anytime, sport.
I adore him.
Well, you're a tower of support.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Did he promise?
Beats a lawsuit.
Hardly...
No.  I missed that.
We're great.
Really?
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Panes is not on your team anymore.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
I guess.
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Uh-huh.
No you're not.
Very well put.
What?
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
I'll be your best friend.
I think he's really angry with me too.
A lot of cakes.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
They're nothing like us.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
God willing.
Let's just go home, okay?
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Not at all.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Yeah.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Not enough.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
I'm worried about your Galiano.
Yes.  Fine.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
You don't need to thank me.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Ah.
Hm.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Oh Soph...
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Neither does Joe.
Not nice.  Not kind.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Well...  I declared war!
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
I'm Princess Bala.
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Superior numbers, kid!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Oh, no, sir!
Thank you, sir.
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Oh, of course --
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Under the mat? 
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Oh!
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
So I see.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
How many of those drinks did you have?
This is a bad day for me.
Why?
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
You don't want me here --
Someone from the office.
In his apartment.
No -- it's my stomach.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Give what up?
Gin.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
I just want some fresh air.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Oh.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
I'm fine all over.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
That's right, Baxter.
You better.
Yes, sir.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Swap them? For what?
Yes, of course.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Sir?
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Mine?
How's that again?
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
No!
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
I have a vague idea.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Let me get my bag.
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Something like that.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Not particularly.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
I took sleeping pills.
No.
I don't know.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
You know I liked it better long.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Handle what?
He wouldn't.
The nerve.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Lovely. You were a big help.
It's a thought.
Well --
We need all our fuel.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
My men --
Esprit de corps --
One for all -- all for one --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Sure, thanks.
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
I don't know.
Probably is.
That we're dumber than we look.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Yeah, I know.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
I'll go with him --
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
What is it?
Which way? Right or left?
Anyone got a cigarette.
Yeah, it still runs.
Charlie?
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
About what ?
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
Sure -- fine --
What?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
Boss left.
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
Yeah.
Yeah, I like it...
What Truth?
No water.
Fuck no.
We'll exterminate the fuckers !
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Yes, I know...
Both of us...
Just something I read in the Free Press.
Yeah... thanks.
Which one's the Colonel's?
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
What is this bridge?
So Kurtz is alive.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
What did you hear?
What things?
Yes.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
Wait 'til I'm across!
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
26   CONTINUED:  
Be careful -- there're two of them.
I bet you haven't had lunch.
Come here...
That's my line.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Forget it.  It would take days.
I'm here to do my job.
You don't get it, do you?
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
You don't know how true that is.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
No, I better stay at my post.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
What are you talking about?
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
Fuck you.
Any idea who could've done it?
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
They'll have to come right past us.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
I'm a waitress.
Since forever.
Yes.
I've got Jews at my table.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
I see the help -- judgement call.
No.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
What are you doing here?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
Carol the waitress?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
You take off when you have to.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
It's one idea...
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Okay.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Good night.
All right, cut me a break.
I just love her.  How're you doing?
I'll take care of myself --
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Two years ago...
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Do it.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Well, I can't reach them.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Thank you for walking him.
Thanks.
Got any easier questions?
Never a break. Never.
You consider your life easy.
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
What's it mean?
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
So you're from around here?
What is this?
I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
How long have you been freelance?
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
Sure.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
The contract was stolen.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
The contract?
I bet you fucking know!
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Yes.
The C.I.A.?
You were like a boy genius?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Ahhhh...
Why not?
Why?
Tell me about the first time.
Yes.
That's fiction.
Several.
Sorry.
Transmits and receives.
But he won't shoot you right then?
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Except --
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Yes.
Yes.  Here I am again.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
So?
Why?
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Are you attracted to me?
It can be.
Yes.
She was taken.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
What?
Right.
Okay.
Oh, God.  I see it!
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Anytime.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
That's correct.
I have all day.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
That makes you an expert I guess.
Thought of everything haven't you.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Who put a bee up your butt?
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Why don't we go together?
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
She's cool.
Tell me some bad news?
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
Do you know the way?
No, by road?
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Yes.
No!
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
What? You are crazy!
So, we won't be going to London?
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
Fernet and tonic.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
It's not so much.
Yo, dobree!
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Ah, so what?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
Deal!
What for?
No, it should be over soon.
Sometimes.
Hmm, I still owe him.
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
I insist, it is the least we can do.
No problem, is it at your place?
But I have to finish this....
No way, he even gave me back pay.
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
Yes, if you can get him free.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
I'll tell her you were here.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
-- I like the car I have.
Me neither.
Late night.  You?
I could take after Dad, too.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
You do --
York Ave.
Demented.
What kind of a man are you, son?
-- This your idea of small talk?
Like me.
It's private.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
And you have to meet my father.
That is my telescope.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Don't you?
Yeah --
That sounds like horseshit.
What?
I wanted this to be a date.
No.
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Loved?
What about your father?
Sure.
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
That what you do?
Anything you want.
Better. I was really angry.
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
Yes.
Like what, sir?
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Either. Both.
I'm not tired.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
I'm no dummy.
I'd work backstage or something?
When do I get time for me?
Where did you get -- ?
Yeah.
What do you want, Biff?
I beg your pardon?
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Fine.
Poly-what?
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
What's this all about?
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Home, school, here... 
Yeah,  Right.
Shhhhhhhh!
Then where the hell is he?
Is Shemp all right?
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
That's just great!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Perfect...
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
What did you do to yours?
Okay.
Yeah.
I used to throw trash for the City.
Thanks.
What's your friend's name?
You love him?
Nah, I got me a job.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
I don't care.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it would hurt.
Put that down. It's dirty.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I'm serious.
It was going too fast.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
No.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Yeah.
I just don't want to go.
Yeah.
Really?
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Stay as long as you like.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
What is it, Tommy?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
You don't wanna know.
Go where?  Where're you going?
It's too dangerous.
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
Why me?
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
...I know this must look... funny.
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
What are they like? What are they about?
I want to know!
Hah!
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Drown all those rascals...
What DID you mean?
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
It's still a little early for me.
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I need help, Audrey.
Ever act?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started?
He's a great writer ?
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
To do what?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland ?I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Yes... Isn't it?
Okay... a quick one, sure...
Can be. Not easy, but ?
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game ?door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
And I could tell you some stories ?
Seen a doctor?
Nope.
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
That's all right, really ?
Hi, Charlie.
Seems like nothing but, lately.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
I've gotta call the police ?or you could call for me ?
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Congratulations.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
What do you do, Fink?
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
All of which he's now missin'.
Only fry you once.
You two have some sick sex thing?
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul ?well, all right, a little bit, for the critics ?but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
Bring 1976 up.
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
Thank you.
Who?
Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
No.  I mean it, thank you.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
What did she tell me, Beth?
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
What?
Yes.
I quit.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
Thanks.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
No.
Fine.
Fine.  How's your back?
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
Try me.
Why?
Of course I knew.
Did you miss me?
What happens to them?
No thank you.
No.
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Do you remember his name?
I went over last night, too.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
I feel fine!
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
Catherine told me what was in it.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
I'm sure.
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
She killed him.
You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
It was an accident.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
Did you check all four years?
No. Should I have?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Do you ever get sick of it?
The whole thing ?painting.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
That's good. At least they're interested.
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
You want a drink?
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
They're just words.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
You mean like an ape?
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Yes, but as a black painter ?
What?
You're not?
Not black.
Who said that?
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Should there be?
Willie Mays.
Oh ?you mean black people!
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
I guess it was a long time ago.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
It's Monday morning.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
You mean babies with you?
What's that about?
Hi.
Thanks
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I'll make you another one.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Yes and no ...
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Yeah?  Me too...
"We"?  You and...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Photojournalist.
Nor I, on the second.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Weird, huh?
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
What seems to be the problem?
Coming on line now, sir.
You'd be surprised.
Alfred's happy here.
Divide and conquer.
I didn't kill your wife.
I can make it.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
What are you talking about?
Maybe he melted.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
Can I get some help over here?
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Adam and Evil.
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
I find that unlikely.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Then you never loved me?
I think they're getting worse.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
Enigma.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
Banzai.
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
Not much.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
Excuse me.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
I don't want to remember!
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
Excuse me.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Bruce, you can't.
How could I forget?
Yesssssss. I know!
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Never heard of a double-cross?
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
Miss.
What are you talking about?
WHICH CAR?
I know. I called them.
Well -- I think you might consider
I loathe bats.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
... Terror.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
Finding out where she is.
What now?
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
What are you talking about?
What are you, scared of heights?
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
... Behind the makeup?
What?  I improved her a little...
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Yeah. Deja vu.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
One.
David, I'm serious!
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Excuse me.
Ahm.... .
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
And a car.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
And Boot-Head.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
Huh? Huh huh.
Uh... butt-snatch...
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Oh, that's nice.
Cut the power!
Deep and hard.
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Not now Bork.
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
Uh, ten uh...
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
They make gypsies look good.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
<u>You</u> left me.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Of course I did.
<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Maybe we should knock first?
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
Who did the sushi?
He might have hurt somebody.
I didn't --
All right.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
Is this like a trick question?
I got an A!
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
Now, let's get rolling!
No.  You don't want his help.
About what?
No, wait!
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Good girrrl!
You've got to help them.
... I will.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Let me have it.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
I cannot believe this.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
I saw some ghosts.
I'm sorry already.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Maybe Charles does.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
But not for long...
Oh, fine.
... Straight out?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes, Robert. I will.
It's fine today, Robert.
Hardly any, Robert.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Thank you, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
Yes, sir.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
No. I like this attic very much.
There's no need for a hospital.
Yes. I am.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
I agree.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Yes.
... Mentor...?
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Our greenhouse.
Thank you, Eve.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
Thank you, Eve.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Yes. I like to watch.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
I don't want Robert.
I certainly do.
Yes. I like that name very much.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
I agree.
Yes. I am very hungry.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
A flower...
Yes. I would like to do that.
Hello, Ronald.
Yes.
Oh. Thank you.
I never needed money.
No.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
It's very sore.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
... Yes. You can take me.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Yes.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes.
I am a very serious gardener.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
I see...
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
I was given meals, and a home...
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
... Hello.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... Nothing.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Good evening, Wilson.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Oh? What?
Good. Anything else?
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Yes, I did.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
Oh yeah, he's good.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Tell your friends.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
The monkey.
I'm a puppeteer.
She's very beautiful.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We抣l smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
No they're not.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
You came up here looking for the portal?
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Holy shit, yes!
Simulates?
That... was... no... simulation.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
My name is Schwartz.
Forget it.
I said "yes."
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
Yessir.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
I wouldn't know.
No, really.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Maxine.
Just.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
I'll protect you, Dollface.
My God.
You're evil, Maxine.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Fork ah did?
Think, Jew florist?
Do you?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
No, I didn't know that.
Why not? I need to get in there!
Yes, Hi.
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
No.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
What the fuck is going on?
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
It's okay, my sweet.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
Derek Mantini!
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
Don't pay to complain.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
May I come in?
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am..
Fine. But what would I do at night?
In case of what?
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Mama?
He's sleeping in the church.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
You was friends.
I run him off.
For what?
It ain't what you think.
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
She was my best thing.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
That is for the urn.
My rug.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Walter, how--
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
They were Nazis, Dude?
No--
Well--
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Yes, uh, very impressive.
I'm not really, uh.
Lebowski on the right?
He's handicapped, huh?
Nancy's pretty good.
Different mothers, huh?
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
I see.
In the briefcase?
...Also, my rug was stolen.
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
You're not interested in sex?
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
He fixes the cable?
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
The main guy, Dieter--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
What?
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Am I wrong!
Huh?
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
No, you're not wrong--
Huh?
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Walter, please--
Whose toe was it, Walter?
But Walter--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Dude--
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
Yeah?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
He can't walk, Walter!
Wha. . . Donny--
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Are you employed, sir?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Well we--I don't--
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
Am I wrong!?
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
He's half yours, partner.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
Survival.
I'll heal.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Why?
I don't understand.
I want to see the sun rise.
You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
I wouldn't worry about it.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
So?
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Not that I'm in contact with.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Look, what's your problem?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
Watch me.
But I just got here --
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
It worked, didn't it?
He didn't. Get over it.
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
And that's a good thing?
He will.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
For your miracle cure?
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I've been better --
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
I'm not leaving without you.
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
Deacon brought me back.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Then what is it?
No problem.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
Go on, I'll be fine!
He killed them?
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
Not the only things missing, Nick.
Oh, sorry, right.
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
I want to see the tapes.
--bullshit!
Get your goddamn--
No.
Whatever you want.
I know, I know.
I can't let you in.
I want amphetamines.
Both. Now.
No.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
What? That made her lose the baby?
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
Yeah?
What're you doing with all this shit?
--coming out of the water--
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
--Cotter: shut up.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
<u>What</u>--
For "James?"
Anna's the witch.
--turn the camera off--
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
Spite.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
Enough to keep sane.
What're you nuts--
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
You planning on sleeping out there?
At least you still have the tapes.
Why she kills children.
Then I have no idea.
What?
Sure. I'm sorry.
Get some more beer.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Whatever.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
Yeah.
Shoot.
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
What happened to my Dad??
Yes.
I am?
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
Sort of...
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Thanks.
...Mm-hmm.
Abby--
Ray--
All right...
What do you want to know?
With your gun?...
Remy.
Going out with Meurice.
I own the place.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
...Hell.
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
It's not strictly legal.
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
Ya catch any fish?
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Nah, I trust ya.
Meurice...
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
I'm not sick.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Yes?
Yes.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Yeah.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Then, shut up!
If you want to.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
No.
See my nipples?
No. please. I won't.
What?
Do you know?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Frank is coming?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Kiss me.
Just get outta my bed.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
It's okay. it's okay.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Okay Frank.
That's too bad.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Maybe so.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I don't know. he moved away.
Yeah. Good bye.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
That sounds good.
Why not?
He got a little jealous.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
Yes.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Okay.
Go ahead!
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Alright.
Of course, Jeffrey.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah.
That sounds great!
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
You can change it if you want to.
Okay.
... Stop it Mike.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Um-hmm.
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
I see.  How much?
It's your grass.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Nice doing business with you, George.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Yeah.  She told me.
I don't want to talk about it.
Not really, no.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Good night.
I would if I could get some sleep.
Because they caught me?
Now do you see what I am saying?
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
Just sell it, Derek.
Just a friend.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
Oh, I see.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
It's beautiful.
Power?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
Yeah, well...
Yeah.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Tough spot.
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
That was a beautiful message.
What about him?
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Out.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Dad.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
You mean, like a trip?
But I've got school.
Swear on my life.
Shhhh.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Who speaks Spanish?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
And you believe the NLF?
And here?
Sail.
Second district ...
The NLF has condemned you to death.
I'll explain.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
It's a question of habit ...
I think it'll be a success ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
Why?
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
A name?
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
It could've happened to anyone.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Cause?
But there's more?
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Increase his heart rate.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
You get his statement?
No.  I haven't done it in years.
No -- never.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yeah.
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
We were lovers.
I had a bad heart.
It didn't.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
No.
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
You called him?
No.
Oriental medicine.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
I thought the subject was sex?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
What would?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
She's mistaken.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Of course.
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
No -- you're not.
Shoot him.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
Why?
No, Your Honor.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
How often do you use cocaine?
We're supposed to go to the lake.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Where have you been?
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
It didn't get there from me.
Oh Jesus.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
'82.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
No. We're going to lock this up and --
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Heat is heat.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
Oh, that'll be nice.
Yeah.
Hmm-mmm.
After the divorce.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Want another cigarette?
Sure.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
Must be nice having kids.
I think so.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
I told you, I love other people.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Why?
Near the church.
Because I already tried once.
I had a temper.
What?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
No.
Well, what is this?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
But now that you have it -
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Yes. And I've accepted.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Later. Go back to sleep.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
I can't sleep.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
What happened?
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
How the hell should I know?
Just some flies.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
What?
Where we'll always be...
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
How did you get in here?
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
I have to finish this for class.
You mean as opposed to your life?
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
You moved into this block?
I can't find you.
That's the past.  It's dead.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Now you.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
Yeah, you heard of him?
Potential toxic dump site.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
No thanks.
But the place burned to the ground.
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
What we have to do is call the police.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
Know what?
Where's what?
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
What the fuck is going on?
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
What are you, drunk?
Why?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
All right, Caesar.
But it could be anywhere.
No.
This is insane!
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What?
Where, then?
Just hurry.
Don't tell him --
Shut up!
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
No.
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Caesar, you still got the money?
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Where in the hell is he?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
He said you lost something.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
Maybe.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
I guess I wanted to.
So am I.
Shit, here we go.
What choice?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
You think I'm lying?
Yeah, twice.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
An accident.
He won't.
If he does ...
I won't.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
No.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Caesar wants me to stay.
I think everything is okay.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
...they won't let you go...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
So it's time to go home.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Yeah, I know...
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Really.
Okay.

It's a little late for that.
No.
Nothing.  It's just not there.
I thought about it.  I don't know.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
Go ahead.
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
Nykwana Wombosi. 
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.

Not really.
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
-- here we go -- I found it --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
...elephoned sir.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
... yer ducts.
What? How do you know my name?
You don't have to sing it.
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Ah ...
What is it?
What has Tuttle done?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Very smart.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Ah.
Where are you taking me?
Really.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Cut it out, Sam.
Oh God! What have we done?
Go away.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Yes.
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
Don't worry.
What a BITCH!
What?
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
This is your dream girl, is it?
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
You haven't switched it on.
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Actually, I've decided ...
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
I know, I know ...!
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
Fixed?
Fixed itself.
Have you got one or haven't you?
Who fixed your ducts?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
Are you saying this is illegal?
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
No ...
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
No!
I can't hold up my head anymore.
No.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
He's working a double shift.
How is she?
Okay.
He's better, though, right?
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
The ghosts--
I think the worst is over.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
I need a drink, that's all.
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
It's early for him.
Who with?
Let me think.
You learn that in the army?
Frank!
No shit.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
What?
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
He's drunk.
What?
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
London.  That's a promotion!
Yes.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Good.
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
No.
This is important to me.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
Your hair's a little funny.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
So I quit.
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
Almost immediately.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
Yes?
I spent a fortune on this.
Right there, Bobbie.
That's okay.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
No.  Not even you.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
So great -- right?
How are you at back rubs?
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
How's it going?
Yes.
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Okay.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
What?
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Oh, good.
Good.  That's it...See you.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Where are you?
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
I can't be.
Through the closet.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.
Whaddya mean?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
A thing I made.
Honest?
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Me too.
Carla...
Yes Walter.
Thank you.
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Carla -
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Forget it.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Hm.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Not only that, he copied us!
I know, man.
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Didn't you hear him?
Enough already about it - get to work!
Have a seat -
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
Put it down, Walter.
Yeah?
Excuse me I have to make a call...
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
You're like an undercover guy!
C-connection?
Smack?
You are?
Uh, I don't know.
Here here!
Really?
Gee.  Thanks.
I was just straightening up the place.
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Amazing!
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
Bummer metaphor.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
Let me in.
Yeah, I guess.
Eeyuu.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
You were having a nightmare.
'Bye.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
No...
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Water.  Okay.
Yeah?
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
Where?
Get out of my facial.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
She --
I have cheerleading squad.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Who we gonna beat?
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
I...
Not if you're careful.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
I guess.
Thanks.
Nicole...
My parents have money...
Really?
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Hi, Grueller.
Could be.
Okay, what else?
Nee sitch.  No way.
Does Jeffrey know?
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
My right nostril?
A little better.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
Oh--won't YOU come in?
--but you're father's in there!
I got lured.
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
What do you believe in?
I want you desperately!
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
You okay?
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
Who's he play for?
We gonna fuck or what?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
If you believe in Voodoo.
You missed him!
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
Go for it.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
It's time you started working on your interviews.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
You fuck!
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
No.
You too...Meat.
And where can I go?
I ain't hitting a man first.
See ya at the yard, Meat.
We'll pray anyway.
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
Where does he go?
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
What are you talking about?
Why are you doing this to me?
Hello, Senator.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Was I at that dinner?
Philip, if you would rise.
I'm serious. No interference.
It's a pity in this...
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
Watch it, partner, watch it!
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Wait, hold on a second.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
Listen...
You mean, I have your permission?
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
Okay.
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
Why, somebody's complaining?
All right.
In so many words, yes.
Hey.
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
No, I don't wanna come -
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
What people?
What are you -
You never - ?
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Well...
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
What can I do?
No, Ace.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
Nice to see you, Senator.
Oh, no.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
Yeah, I know all that.
I - I - I...
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's chinchilla.
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
What do you need?
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
You can trust me.
What?
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Mm.
What if he won't stop?
Listen to me.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
Mr Rothstein.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
I really think you're -
You're firin' me?
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
God! 
Thanks, Nick.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
You can't talk to me like...
Hey.
I can't.
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
Oh.
Carmine left?
We can't help him if -
I know.
I'll tell him, Remo.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Ma che cazzo!
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Okay, Sammy.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
You're so nice. 
It's all right.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Mm-hm.
You did. You're right.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Come on. Don't be scared.
A sponsor.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
What about my money?
Ginger, honey.
What's the matter?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
Listen...
Are they out now?
All right.
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
I think that's it.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Two.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Get up.
What's takin' so long over there?
I took care of everybody.
Remo.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Yeah.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Well, I'm a little confused here.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
Then do it the way you want.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Winning.
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
What about "climbing in?"
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
Stop.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
Not too cool...
But I'm blind.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Yes, Mother. Dear.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Do I hear a woman's voice?
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
You could've killed us.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
Why would I do that?
I'm going to level with you officer.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
What do you keep making me out to be?
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
What are you doing now?
How much time do you have left on it?
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
That's not her.
No.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
The City National on San Vincente.
What do you mean?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Lucky for them they didn't.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
L.A.P.D.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
You wouldn't --
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
Why are we stopping?
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
That's not good enough.
You won't live to see it.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
Didn't we play this scene before?
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
Keep talking.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
We don't see you.
Stay there.
Talk to the man.
I thought you'd know me by now.
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
In your dreams.
Government business?
How?
See what, Dil?
Yeah?
Hi, Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
It's Dave.
Not in my experience.
Like treacle.
They all get the wrong idea.
No, I didn't --
Where?
What look?
Must be.
Whiskey.
Shouldn't I go?
Yes...
Didn't think I could.
I know that.
So they do know.
Sorry.
Are you pretending yet?
Okay.
Why, honey --
Kind of.
Anything.
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
I was trying to get out of something.
My pills...
Prescription. For my condition.
You knew my Jody?
You knew my Jody?
In a manner of speaking.
I suppose I tried.
He asked me to see were you all right.
Stop it, Dil --
Let me go, Dil
More what?
Yes.
It's my name, Dil --
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Do I?
Will I see you again?
Yes. Say hello to Col --
That's wise, Tommy.
Someone's got to do it.
Leave me alone, Jude.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
You know what. Go.
Was I?
And what if you don't?
Some judge...
I take pride in my work.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Would make me feel better about it.
Who'd you think it was?
Should blow you away, you know that?
Definitely unusual.
Right.
So, what do I look like?
No fucking way.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
So I've noticed.
You want to bet?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
She's not my type.
Don't I know it.
My pleasure, Jody
Hurry up, would you?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Don't be so sure.
Having a pint in the Rock.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Some kinds of women are...
If they kill me --
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
I told you not to talk that way --
I'm sorry.
Hurling --
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
You didn't?
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
Where are you, ol' buddy?
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
I think that's what you ordered.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
How do you think I got here?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
With whom? Where?
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Agent.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
His -- real -- ?
Very sweet.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
The last one, please.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Brian.
No.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Okay -- up there.
Me?
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
I met a man with sharp nails.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
There must be some way.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Oh. 
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
I dare you.
Go on.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
Not unless we're blind.
But his mother --
Swiss.
I don't know. I suppose so.
I don't know.
I wish you wouldn't.
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
We won! We won!
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
How do you know what they're doing?
Words can hurt very much.
Please stop -- please!
Didn't Charles have any friends?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
What's the matter, ch閞ie?
We want that money -- now!
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
Calm down Brent.
It won't happen again.
I want you to head right home after school.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
No I wasn't.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
No?
Are you sure?
She's still a virgin.
You know where I can find her?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
Who's?
Really?
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Why?
I don't watch him eat everyday.
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
Twenty eight years ago.
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
No.
I did.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
This party is sick.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
You can ask me anything.
Yeah. Who is she?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
The library. I'll be fine.
Who is she?
The word is Mob.
The principal?
No, you keep one.
No.
If sheep don't count.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
 No.
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
For cryin' out loud.
I need your help.
Peace.
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
That dog was mean before I met him.
...all the time.
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
You're nuts, goin' back there!
Doesn't work.

And I'm a peaceful man, and...
 Yeah...
 
Back up!  Back...

Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
God, man!
Come on.
You okay?
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 

Hey!
...to him!  You don't know who...
I'm crazy?
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
What?
Worth a try.
...stole the truck.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
So you took his...
So I took his truck, yeah.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
I mean, if that gun was...

Are you all right?

What?
Reach into my pocket.

Okay.
  I've got the real thing!
Tunnel.
What do you think I'm doin'?!
What the--?
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!

...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
Hello.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
I think so too.
That's bullshit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
...about him.
This country trained me to kill...
...such is the price...of patriotism.
So...where's my truck?
...help you?
  Hey, actually...
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
...owe you.
...including the permanently extreme.


Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
Any of them Richard Long?
...to be off the island tonight.
It's too...
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
Pleasant surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.

Odd, then, that his car...
Like I say, Doc Long's...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
You try anything, it goes in...
Where's Arlo?

Doc!
How much longer for the range and power projections?
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...

BLACK BACKGROUND.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Jake, for Christ's sake.
That's right.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
A ruler?
Do you know him?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
How did you find out?
I've got her.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
I think I'll kill her.
Oh they don't?
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Curly, where's your car?
Okay.
I said okay, Jake.
Summer colds are the worst.
I get by.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
No.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Too late for what?
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Do you know where she might be?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Mrs. Mulwray?
What do you mean?
...Just a minute...
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
It wasn't much of a lie.
But he wasn't killed.
He told you?
Did he know?
No, not for that one.
Another satisfied client's wife.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
What dam?
The Valley?
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
Doing what?
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
Sure.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
What the hell is this all about?
Katherine.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Only when I breathe.
Yes?
Well, no.
Never.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
But...
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
He owned it.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Well, you never know, do you?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
Toto, come here.
Why? What do you mean?
That's right, Modern Times.
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
For what?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Thais.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
He made an awful lot of money.
It didn't end very well, did it?
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Who said anything about brooms?
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Yes.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Are they standing for me?
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
There is no news big enough.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
We've got a nice plant here.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Yes, Mr. kane.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
Can you prove it isn't?
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Yes, sir. 
Can't say, sir.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
Yes?
Good.
Charlie -
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
She was going to leave you anyway -
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
I know you will.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
Sure.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Well, thanks a lot.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
What did you get?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
You're shittin' me.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Can I join in?
Just now.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
Jesus, you're caustic.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Sang.
He's your fianc?
I'm just kidding.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Um... okay.
Was it you?
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Oh God...
Nobody. It was closed.
Excuse me?
Yes.
To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Go open the sore.
Why?
What do you two fight about?
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
That's cheating?
That girl was vile to you.
Your mother.
That's frightening.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
What kind of show?
The milkmaids?
All of them.
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
FUCK!
I don't back down.
I'm going to miss the game.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Sorry.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
Can we not talk about this?
Exactly. They drank it all.
Yeah, right.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
That's embarrassing?
I never tried it.
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Let me borrow your car.
What?
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
And this is what you rented?
I don't; you did.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Because I'm happy.
I'm happy.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Why do I have this life?
Oh, like your life's any better?
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Same time. What about you?
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
Jesus Christ, what next?
How much can you bench?
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
How do you know that?
I should start.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Veronica.
Maybe.
She's my girlfriend.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
I hate this fucking place.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Hunhh? Nothing.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Really?
I touched a nerve.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many what?
Including you; yes.
I'm not the pig you are.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Um. Thirty-seven.
Thank you for the lasagne.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
WHAT?
You said you were here all day?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
Scumbag. What are you doing?
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
You'll be missed.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
I don't know.
What usually eats a banana?
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
Hey, fuck you.
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
My pleasure.
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
After the funeral I just had to leave.
I don't expect you to understand.
Why are you yelling?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Flare up of old emotions...
He can handle it.
You know me, I'm a night person.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
Of course I do.
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Next time, date only basketball players.
Get it!
What?
This rope is sixty years old!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
I won't do it.  No way.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Never could save a thing.
Anyone else following?
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
Let's move your ass in there!!
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Good morning, Walt.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Try the wine!
Who are they, sir?
Well, shall we get down to it?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
I did, sir.
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
Well, how are you then?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Lice?
How're you feeling this morning?
We're going to friends now, sir.
You mean like going to the pictures?
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
You're not cured yet, my boy.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Bottega.
Just had one.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Then let's have it.
Federal?
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Wouldn't dream of it.
Twenty five?
Very generous.
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
What thing?
So?  It was a random thing.
Oh?
Pick me up in five minutes.
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Not our call, Phil.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
What's your name?
Try?
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
What happens if you don't?
Let's not get excited, sir.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
You always stutter?
I don't think I can do this.
It's not me.
South Central.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
I need the job.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Yes, Max?
I listen to classical.
I never learned jazz.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
Don't start.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
In case <u>who</u> checks?
Dmitri?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
Some living.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
That's what you said...
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
Why the hell not?
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Mississippi?
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Shut the hell up.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Motive?
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
You bit someone's nose off?
For what?
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
What is it with you and the space program?
I have no idea.
Surprise me.
This would be it?
Who?
Getting rid of my hub!
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
How is it possible?
Not this again.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Right here in Manhattan.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Not today.
Come on.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Because he believed me.
You saw me standing alone ...
You think it's a conspiracy?
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
I don't know...
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
We're very specialized.
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
Not today...
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
No.  Not yet.
Wasn't my idea.
What do you mean?
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
What do you suggest?
Yes, sir.
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
I'm willing to take that risk.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
David --
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
With me.
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
You want to classify prime numbers?
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Now... you go home.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
No.  Please.
Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
That's my girl...  Lights.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
-- of Hadden Industries.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
Actually --
-- I'm moving to Washington.
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Wait -- hold on a minute --
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Yes.  Very much.
Why?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
I can't do this --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
In other words.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Git movin', I said.
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
Git to work!
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
Borrowin'.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
What happened? How far did you get?
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
A Lucas Jackson.
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Take it easy, Drag.
On my own.
Thass right. Just play it...
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
That fool. That damn fool.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
No. No chains either.
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
About what?
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
What pattern was that?
What Friday?
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
Who was the man in the basement?
Where are you, Peter?
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
Then what do you need me for?
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
<u>What</u>?...
I know, baby.  I know.
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
Honest to God, Ruben!
Tell it to your shrink.
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
That's always your privilege, sir.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
Helen Hudson...
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
Or the F.B.I.?
Give me Ruben back...
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
And her husband? What was he?
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
It does.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
No. But when he's in that car...
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
One of your suitors?
Yes.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
She said she'd be here at 10.
I ruined your wedding night.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
You too, Mom.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
When did you start smoking?
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
I've already made arrangements.
There's a spider in my room.
I'm glad.
By color.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
I wasn't hungry.
So are you engaged, or what?
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Exactly.
Don't be ridiculous.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Do you?
But I do.     I love you, too.
Home free.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Thanks.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
Are you OK?
The restaurant, too?
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
Coming.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
Michael, take it easy.
I guess so.
And all the plans we have.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
Something you did?
So, what do you say, Let?
No, no.
No.
I love him.
I heard about your friend.
I think I've heard this speech before.
I'll float you.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
Where did they go?
What?   This?
It's me...
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
You're calling me on is phone?
Oui.
It's Daniel.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
I'm good.   Really.
I'm not here to negotiate.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
Yes.
Thank you.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
We'll think of something.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
Has to be.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
What'd you get?
Can I trust you, Sami?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
How much?
Hard to say.
What'd they take?
Okay boss.   Where are they?
Oh, I'm sorry.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
I'm not going to leave you.
God, I want to go home.
The baseball is mine.
No.
No!
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Cool.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
Thanks.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
A little?
Then leave her to me.
What's it to you?
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
I'm just playing around.
Let's go!
I owe you nothing.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
Really?
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
You coward!
Give me back my comb.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
I left the training early.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
Have you questioned him yet?
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
Father!
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
Annie, I need a file.
I knew that.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
I dabble.  May I?
Mister Funboy lives there?
No.
I think he's yours, now.
In a better place.  I hope.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Yes.
Leave me alone -- !
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Very well, it's your ass.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Kill a dead guy?
"Our" Crow...?
Annette Harrison.
I don't think so.
You might say that.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
Forever.
Junior.
No.
No.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
What'cha reading?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
That's a matter of opinion.
What? Another letter from your friend?
Give me the fucking letter.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Why not?
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
Yes it does.
I do not.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
No.
I think that's for the best.
Hi.
I love you.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
It's Kathryn.
Something awful happened last night.
I don't know.
Well did you like it?
I did?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
Just taking your photo.
Is it me?
You do?
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Honey, is something wrong?
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
You told her I never said I love you before?
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
I told you I don't know.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
Outstanding.
What?
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
I'm aware.
Yippy.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
She shot you down.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Mock, mock, mock.
I want to fuck.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
I've never done this before.
You wanted an answer to your question.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Get out!
And if I don't?
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Do you know where she is?
Do you know when she'll be back?
Yes, you already did.
We played backgammon?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
You're a lucky guy.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself ?tell the truth --
Yes, darling.
Oh, lots of times.
Are they nice?
What's her name?
Irena.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
Times have changed.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
What do you mean?
Well, it seemed to me --
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
Yes, daddy.
It was on account of the birthday party.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
But...
But there's no one here, darling.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
This is more fun than just pretend.
But we don't have any sea weed.
Your children?
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Oh, please!
You wanted to share this moment with me.
But she's dead!
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days ?those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
Yes, yes -
Look at me.
My daughter died long ago.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
Come away, Amy.
That's from her -- that woman.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
Go on -- out with you.
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
We'll see that she gets there in good time
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Your lips look delicious.
I've been working out.
I mean where on your body?
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
People notice you Frida.
Maybe he's just shy.
Frida, grab that red one.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
I think he called you beautiful.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
Frida, Carlton's dead.
What? Why'd you do that?
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
I'm not really hungry after all.
Well, whattdaya think?
On your desk.
Are you following me?
Goodnight.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
No, I got it. It's okay.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
What? Is there someone else?
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Okay.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
How big?
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
Tell her I'm eating.
Take some allergy medicine.
We can just take this pillowcase.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
We only live a few blocks apart.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
What makes her think that?
And that was 28 days ago today.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
He's seriously disturbed...
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
You are mistaken.
Good.
Fine.
Why are they after you?
No.  Have a look.
It must be a closet or something.
You know something about me?
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
Yes.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
They're dead, John.
Right.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
No...
) Listen, you little...
I can't believe he'd do this.
Bob...
TilT we figure something out.
I was a senator, you know.
What about containment, Alan?
Fine.
Clean.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
Bob...
Just what you think I mean.
Dave -- I'm working.
You could buy it on payments.
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Extend things?
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
What?
Really?
I can't say.
I can't say.
Anybody would have done it.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
You find people jobs?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
I know.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
Leave him.
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
Look.
Quiet!
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
What is it if it ain't a curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Sir!
In the battle, sir.
I'm alright. Let's go.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Women swoon!
Hey, this is great.
So you really think she means you're going with her?
I'll tell you later.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
What?
But...
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
What good will that do?
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
Knox?!
The pleasure is mine.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Dead Poets honor.
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Courtyard?
YAWP!
A crazy madman.
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Okay.
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
I'm calling her!
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Todd Anderson.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
Nothing.
I don't want to read.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh. 
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
I'll come to the performance.
Yes.
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
And where is our point of arrival?
Which question is that?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
Did you clear this?
That's where my boat's moored.
You're saying they can think?
A meat locker.
You ain't giving the orders here!
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
That way.
A little to the left...
Line it up now, nice and easy...
Poolside?
Hey! Come out here!
She fucked you?
Yeah.
Good... Pass the beer.
Get the boots.
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Hey! Fuckin' A!
I'll get it! Where is it?
I know, but...
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Yeah.
Yeah.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
No.
But you must come in.
Everybody love Linda.
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Psst. Vince!
Inside, Vince.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
No?
Biederman!
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
No. No, no.
There's Vince!
I don't think about the shot that much.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Pow.
Huh?
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
Merle...
More bullets in the gun?
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
You wanna bet?
Watch it, shithead!
No!!!?
What do you mean, no???
Right.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
It's not socks, Sal.
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Sure.
Technothugs?
Kimberly!
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
When you bring in Doucet.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
I'll be alright.
I'm not voting for you.
And I want Doucet.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
What the hell are you talking about?
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Telephone repairman.
Fine.
Shut up!  Drop it.
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
Pass.
Yes.
Drop it.
I was set up.
I'll be okay.
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
I'm here.
...What are you talking about...?
...Have you been drinking?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
Hospital food.
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
From over the mountain --
Of course I will.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
Young man -- you got me there.
And serve him right!
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
I did not, Grandma.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
No. She's gone.
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
No, you're not.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
The seventh day of April --
I don't care.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Coming.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Tired?
There is nothing to worry about now.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
Jabez!
Hard luck -- like me.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
It don't matter!
You'll be a father any minute now.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
Let him try it.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
You aren't angry with me?
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
I'll do my best, Mary.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
Ellis, what have you told them?
And if he alters it...?						*
Okay.
Go fuck yourself.
I'm going to count to three...
I told you...
Then don't waste time talking to me.
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Sure.  Follow me.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Don't I always?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
I...I shot a kid.
Roy?
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Yeah.
Come on, what's under this?
Yes, I would.
Heidi, I'm dying.
Don't call yourself fat.
It's okay... it's okay...
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
Ooohh....
Yeah.  It was terrible.
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
What trip?
You're crazy.
Where you gonna go?
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
You don't have a choice?
Look... who's on the phone?
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
I'm afraid.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
They're okay.
I'm not alone.
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
We're bringing in your wife...
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Come on, lemme load you up...
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
I don't fool around with you.
What now, Sonny?
They look like good kids.
Special to me, too.
Would I hire you?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
Howard!
No, not until after they killed him.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Pure?
How'd that happen?
What?
I want him to think that.
But I want to know what you think.
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
Wyoming.
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
I am.
Yeah - it looks real official.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Doing what?
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?

I'm pulling up right now. Evacuate the fucking van! Plans have changed! <b> EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT
You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Yes.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
<i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
Take us to Vegas.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]

I was a musician.
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.

Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Have you noticed something about them?
You a troublemaker?
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
I don't know how he does it.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
That's it?
What makes Sammy run?
Wake up!
It's gonna be hot today.
Later.  Gotta get paid.
See ya around.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Yeah, me too.
Fuck!  My money!
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Depends.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
OK.  OK.
I can run out and get it.
I can't be staying long anyway.
Trust me.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Meda.  Meda.
I am a man.

Keep dreaming.
Ya like him, huh?
It's Prince.  He's a Prince freak.
On the rebound.
I ain't getting shit.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
You listening to me?
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Tell Vito.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Whaddup?
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
Actually we have something for you.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
I'll tell you why!
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Famous? I've never heard of it.
I know I am, Mom.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Home school. Til today.
I go to school where I live.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
Why not?
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
The principal.
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.

Exactly! A pirate!
LLOYD, she's my mom.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Who?
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
And with that complete loser
Right.
That's the one I wanted.
Try one in a million!
Oh, you're good.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Not to expect you tonight.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.

You were born free and free you should remain.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Can you believe it?

He passed away three years ago.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
You know I do!
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Wow, you are smart.
Who's there?
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Yes.
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Paul!!  Paul!!
They said you were dead.  They said...
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.

I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.

Mmph?  Where am I?
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Really?
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Formaldehyde.
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Soon, Bela... Soon.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
That's great.  Let's do a take.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
Rolling.
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
This is the big moment...!
These shoes are itchy.
And who may you be?
Oh, just like in the script!
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Does she have room for me?
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
You could say that --
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!

Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
Yes?
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
So you're not a fruit?
Maybe it needs special handling.
This is my thirteenth pair.
Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
What do you mean?
Huh?
Dynamite --
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
Yes?
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
Yes!
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
I do.
Mr. Wood!
NOOOOO!!!
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
Went --
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Really? They were..
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Right.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
Oh my God!!
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
The doctor said you were having sex.
Why? How...
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Shari, Ray feels --
No.
She left.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Welcome to work, Ed.
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
Dynamite.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Oh... how come?
It's... okay
I missed you.
Why?
I know, I ...
I really like you too...
Shari...
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Are you all right?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
No... Could you?
Come on.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
What did you do to your hair?
What?
What is?!
What?
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
No. What happened?
What's the dif --
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Great.
I know.
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
It's Ed.
Oh, man! So...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
What kind of person?
Thank you.
Here, get down.
What?
Dick... Dick,..
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
Ethics are...
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Right
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
As far as I know, they--
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
Why are you lecturing me?
Sporty.
That sounds good.
Doing what?
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
My house.
Would you sign it for me?
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
This weekend.
I have proof.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Should we get a what?
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
I also like bananas.
What?
So?
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
It's not what you think.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Yeah.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
How?
I got to write my report first.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Get the fuck away from me.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
I don't know him.  Mr...
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
What little studio?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
Susan Lefferts.
Believed what?
Dogs got no reason to live.
They shot him in his library.
But you were business associates?
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
What's this all about, lad?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
What?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
I want to do it right.
Of his penis, sir?
Not good enough.
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
Why not?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Something good?
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
What's wrong, Trash?
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
A bootleg...
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
And no one'll know about this?
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
I'm telling you, I--
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
You're not.
Turn on CNN.
Clear as day.
I don't know who he is.
What do they have to do with this?
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
No shit.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
I didn't use my name.
I called from a payphone!
You told me no calls.
What's going on?
<u>Here</u>?!
We're not gonna hurt you.
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
Listen--
What if--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
No.
Not particularly, no.
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
I'll say.
Eight.  Size eight.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
A report?
Because I don't know.
No.
Not that I could see.
No.
Just for the criminals.
Right.
Something bad happened tonight.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
What do you mean?
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Yes.
Well...yeah.
Yeah.
It's over.
Here, you can use this.
Sir?
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
I don't believe it is, no.
It's not?
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Eat your fish.
Will you hang on just a second.
For the last four years.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
--otherwise we may have to--
Brill.
You're firing me.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Really?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
They didn't take the silverware?
Table 122?
Into what?
Christ!
Listen to me.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Are you still in Crystal City?
You would?
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
Fuck you.
I said fuck you.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
We found the originals.
Hiding something?
You're kidding me.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
We don't know.
What's your ETA?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Hello!  Good morning.
I don't want to go back.
As the wife of one of our party.
What do you mean, poetry?
I thought you might paste them into your book.
I'd like you to have them.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
That makes it harder still.
What?  No!
This is empty, just coming!
It's a folk song.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
What?
No.
I know.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
What?
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
What?
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility?
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
No.
I don't know.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Where've you been?
I liberated it.
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
What?
I see.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Are you crazy?
Yes?
Well then - yes.  Of course.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
K is for Katharine.
Never heard of it.

The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I've met you before.
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
You loved him.
Kip?I -
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Then come with me.
I'll always go back to that church.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
This is making me incredibly angry.
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Alm醩y, who doesn't look up from his book.
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
What's he saying?
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
I'm in the middle.
Too late now.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
No. Why would I be?
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
It's not for sale.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
That's my girl.
Give him the card.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
We're only going one way.
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
Good morning.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
No. It's a down payment.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
A dozen times.
One more item--not on the check list.
Terrified. Still am.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Behind you.
Shut up.
A billion dollars.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
My job, my rules.
Right. The eight billion.
And the money goes--
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
It's no good without the argon gas.
You've thought of everything.
We're doing it tonight.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
Suspicious, after all these years?
Check out my ball.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
You're a lawyer?
Yeah.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
It's not about working hard --
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
No shit.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Erin, it's just a meeting.
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Erin --
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
How do you know that?
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Corey.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
You got more than one?
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
How?
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
Thanks for reminding me.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
Thinking.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
That's okay.  I understand.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
What?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Yes?
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Come in, Admiral.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
What's wrong with him?
Okay, okay.
We're not out of this yet.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
You know the Jedi Master?
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Then I'll see you in Hell.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
I'm going to see what it is.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Does Luke know?
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
What was it?
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Or you ran into something ....
Why?
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
The entrance is collapsing!
No lightspeed?
You're going to attack them?!!!
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Never heard of that system.
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
Thanks to you.
No hard feelings?
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Oh my, no!
I thought you knew this person.
What are you talking about?
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
I've never seen it fail.
I thought I was in good shape.
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
That is why you fail.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Free your mind and return he will.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
I'll die first.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
I want that ship.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
We'll see.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
What's in it for me?
Dream on, blue eye.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
Somebody get off!
Having second thoughts?
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
So what does this thing do?
Lock fuel rods.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Where'd they go?
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
We'll see.
Looking to get out.
Which way?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
You need help.
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
Thank God.
Give me the prototype.
Yeah.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
So be it, to the death.
I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
Of Merlin?
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
That's not why you came.
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
The dragon! There...
...of course...
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
Not you, my husband?
You, my lord.
You.
We are to blame.
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
I am the desert, where water disappears--
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Burke.
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Of course I didn't.
No, she was heavily sedated.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
Not that I know of.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
All right then we've got clean rats.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Depression?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
The priest.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
Why, I don't understand?
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
No
Um........Stuff.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
The closet
I don't know
What?
Okay.
Okay.
So what's wrong with her?
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
What's playing.
In here. With us.
Bon Jour.
Uoy era ohw.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
Don't listen.
What's this about?
I once did a paper on it
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Just a minute.
You're not going to drive!
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
How will he eat?
Get your hand off me.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
My pleasure.
Frank.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
You got weird kids, Frank.
Bosen black.  Flat.
Only on odd days.
Why the interest?
I don't gotta go.
You'll see.
It's me.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
We don't get a gig.
Yeah, okay.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Talk.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
Right.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
No, you take the right.
Yeah.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
No. Why?
Celebrating.  Join me?
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
You always threw up.
He was just having fun.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
You could've come.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Who's weak now, big brother?
Later.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
No.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
I'll take the Mallory.
Yeah?
Five years ago.  November.
She asked for it.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
Just call me a cab.
The flu.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
We ran long.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
What's wrong with it?
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Big feet.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
Virgins.
Huh?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
Huh?
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Yes, well, they are.
Thanks, Lloyd.
I'll call you.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
For a while.  She left.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Not for money. With my mother.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
I guess in case one year they're not.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
Nothing.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Sure.
You're kidding.
Look, if you want to leave...
Hi.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
Eddie did.
What happened to the donut king?
What are they?
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Yeah?
Huh? Oh, no.
Eddie.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
How old is he?
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Let me have a look.
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
Is that what you think?
We need to talk.
It's important.
Something good?
And you wouldn't be.
One last time.  It's important ...
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
What more proof do you need?
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
No problem.
What do you know about it?
Have fun at work.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
-- Studying.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
So you left her?  Just like that?
I抦 not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
What about me?
You抮e jumping, sweetheart...
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Where抯 my real dad?
Sure.
Got it.  Good tip.
Big Ed抯.
I don抰 think so.
Kate抯 my wife...
It抯 just two kids, right?
No.
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
You mean because you thought I was cocky I抦 now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
I don抰 think so, thank you...
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Need a nurse?
Are we what, Jack?
It would help me if we were.
No, I didn抰...that抯 great.
How抎 you do this year, Tony?
All in one tape?
For us, Kate.
No, you抮e right.  What are we doing?
Look, you don抰 understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
No, she抯 not.
And...?
That is the general idea, yes...
It抯 ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you抮e gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don抰 have time for wining and dining.
Do what?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I want it...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it抯 light out.
Are you sure?
What are you sure about?
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
I抦 moving to Paris...it was right here...  It抯 a box marked 揓ack.? I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Where is he?
Do I know you?
But you抮e not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Of course I did.
I'd like that, too.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
I've got plenty of places to go.
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
I like the sound of that.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Youthful high spirits.
Five times.
He's made a few changes.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
I'm worried about you.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
Victor did.
Oh, he did.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
And they're changing into...
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Ben, are you there?
You've been working out.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Hilarious.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Never better.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
Yes, thanks.
That's what we're here to find out.
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Victor, are you feeling alright?
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
The Other Side got to him.
Brain injury.
And take a little trip with them...
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Yes?
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
We must!
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
You may learn to like it.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
Yes...
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
I'm married.
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
I could use a lawnmower...
Looks simple to operate.
Then don't drift down further.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
What?
No.
Yeah.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
...The heck d'ya mean?
GOT IT?
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
End a April.
Ya got that right.
White Bear Lake?
Oh sure.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Yah, that can happen.
Uh-huh.
Yah, right -
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
No. No, ma'am.
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Dad's here.
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
No, no, fax is -
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
My patience is at an end.
Yah.
Whatcha watchin' there?
...Who they playin'?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
Well, they -
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Well, I don't vouch for him.
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah.
Yah?
Yah?
Oh, yah?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Yah...
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
Well, they're a good outfit.
No, I didn't...
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
Yah.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Oh, fine.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Yah.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
He's at Norstar.
Right, right.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Yeah, both of us.
Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
Does this sound strange to you?
Who do you think could've done this?
You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.
Sure.
What?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
Marla?
You haven't been going to yours.
So you're staying in tonight?
Nothing.
I could check your prostate.
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
You are an insane person.
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Yes.
Who's this?
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
You fucking slut!!
Who do you think I am?
My suitcase was vibrating?
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
How's that working out for you?
Being clever.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
You get the idea.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Like hell.  That counted.
Anyone?
"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
Any historical figure.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Yes, I promise.
A liposuction clinic.
I don't know...
Work.  Going to work.
Fucking sweet.
Homework assignment.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
Hey.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
What should I have told you?
You know what I mean.
What are you doing?!
Tyler...
What?
Wait a minute...
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
Why do people think I'm you?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Answer me, Tyler.
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
What about Marla?
Um, well... technically, no.
You... you can't be serious about this.
I can't let you...
I'm going to...
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Defuse the bomb, please.
Yes.
Paraffin.
Not exactly according to plan.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
Very good, Sir.
It's free to all.
You and your friend.
Pleeeeeease!
How'd you know?
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
No, please, no, God, no!
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
I...I...
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
We need to hurry.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Yeah?
Yeah, so what happened?
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Like what?
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
Sure.
I...I don't know.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
I know, honey.  I just --
What feeling?
I know, we'll be there soon.
Who am I, David Blane?
Nice try, kiddo.
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
I wish you were on the plane!
Why do you think I was hiding?
That's a plan.
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
That's right, buddy.
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
Yeah...
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
I suppose you have...
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
I thought he was with you.
Spooks?
Nguyen is good boy.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Let's get that tent down!
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
Sorry, Sir.
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Christ almighty.
Have fun.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
You threw him out?
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
The moron?
What does that mean?
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
My agent.  I called my agent.
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
No, it's not... Come here...
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
Uh... basement I think...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
It was a crime.
I... I was just leaving.
Fine.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
How much?
Tonight!  How's tonight?
The Little People?
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
But I can't get it... He's...
You really want to help me?
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
Who?
It's a classic.
Sure...
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
You won't be alone for long.
What a gyp.
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
You don't have to say that.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
You're married.
You have a disease.
I leave it to you.
A wig?
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
I hope they do.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
What the hell is that?
Shut up! All of you!
No.
Is what you?
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
Who?
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Are you talking to us?
Now don't...
Don't, then.
You know who it once belonged to?
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Oh, well, what, what's he...
I know.
Tita, I've got to go...
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Uhm hmm.
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
My turn.
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Bye, Robert.
Then after that?
Tomorrow, then.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
None.
I think it's what you think.
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
That's right.
I'm fine.
Is he?
What?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I'll be back later...
Catherine...
Is she?
What?
It's a Borzoi.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Yes.
Oh, for pity's sake...
Look at me.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Victor.
No.  What you do today?
Just chill.
Good. I'm faithful to them.
Pitt.
For real?
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
You gonna talk to him?
Positive.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
So, then whadda ya want?
Jus' from around the way.
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
You're kidding.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
Your aunt?
Oh, he was dying for years.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Whoops.
Come on in.
Velma.
Check.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
I know.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Sure, all drifters do.
Where am I going?
I wonder if that's his doctor.
I'm sorry?
How long have they been married?
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
So were my parents.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
I saved his life during the war.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
I think you better sit down.
Gail, please.
I checked. There was no divorce.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
I recommend it.
What?
She moved out.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
...never reads the paper...
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Of course.
I said, I ain't got you...
So you...
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Spooky.  I'll process her.
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
Johnny's C.D.?
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
People still watch that?
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
Ye-ah.
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Who's my real father, man?
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
The case!
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Are you okay?
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
No - no.
Goodbye.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
What happens to the schedule?
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
Names.
What's he do?
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Marseilles.
Who's on him?
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Let yourself in.
We put him to bed for the night.
Four.
Whatta you got?
Why is it called Hellgate?
What is that old building?
What was it?
For garbage?
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
So what?
Yeah.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Queens, New York.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Hello?
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
What?
What's happening?
Sun spot?
Yeah...I think so.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
I never knew you, Dad.
October 12, 1969.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
I don't understand.
Something happened, something...
It's Mom.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
You there?
I'm right here, Dad.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Huh?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
Uh, huh.
Yeah.  Sure.
Sounds good.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I hear that.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
You have the right to speak to an att --
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
Cool it, Andy.
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
Barely.
Yes, man!
I love you, man!
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Hello.  How are you?
What?
Somebody was in here.
Are you all right, Shelly?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Sort of.
You're Shelly?
My whole world.
Why don't you help us?
Just keep your eyes on the road.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
My ass.
Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
What's it to ya?
Huh?
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Yes, but they released me because...
There's no time for this bullshit...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
Please don't do anything crazy.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Not so bad, today.
Do you have to ask?
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
I'm now begging you.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Until I hear the truth.
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
She did!
Never.
Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
He bought you that?
Yeah.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
And you'll never do it again.
Rennie's not coming.
It's...dead.
Don't be ridiculous!
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
What are you talking about?
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I'm staying.
She didn't push me into coming.
I...I can't...
I don't know what to say...
There's something I haven't told you...
Hi, Sean.
But I didn't get you one...
Just radio for help, okay???
Please, hurry...
Very bad today.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
It's over, finished and done with.
Asbestos lining.
Do not inhale.
What do I exude?
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What was it like?
Don't wait Efor me.
Where is it?
That was a big mistake.
No, we're not.
Paisley Porter.
What are you talking about?
Yes. What are you implying?
This could be it.
Does what feel comfortable?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
About what?
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
They'll lose because they're my team.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
I'm not sure.
Daddy, wait.
It's only our first date.
Two-all after six.
She's my gynecologist.
It violates so many trusts.
I don't know if I can say that.
This could be it!
Life is real.
Get yourself something to eat.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
You know the answer to that.
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
Since when did that matter?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
What am I doing?
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Life is good.
Because God loves a winner.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
I hear good things about the new play.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
I don't know.
Someone waiting for you?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
I'm going home to my machine.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Everyone takes his turn.
Eleven.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
I thought you were a man of God.
Well, we shall try.
Going nearer to God!
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
A -- a week.
I thought you were against fighting.
We must end the campaign.
Panditji -- please, help me.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
I hope not.
Hm.  Is it?
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
I --
That's when you take advantage.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
I congratulate them.
He's "discovering" India.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
Have you found him?
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Er, no...
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
Grudges?
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
How long do you stay up there before you go?
Any particular reason?
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Michael's.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
Not bad, Jerome.
I'm travelling too.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
I hope he's not just a body.
How do I square the accident?
That's the hair color in his profile?
How tall are you?
Why not?
You worried about the cost?
In the South Wing.
Come on.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
Only every time I'm in here.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
Stay clean.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
Get it over with...
No way. I've got to get out now.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Yeah.
I want to take a walk.
Better than old times.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Fatter... some things never change.
You were asleep.
I couldn't have... much longer.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
What do we do?
You bastard...
I mean it.
I think you liked it with him.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
Twenty eight hundred.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
I don't see how.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
What about you?
Wire pull over?
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
I kinda doubt it.
You serious?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
A Ford... We have a Ford.
How long have you been married?
I'll tell you when.
I know.
How?
Who?
'Good.'
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
I can't Jack. How can I?
We're there now.
Brumby.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Especially when I play the lead.
You've been watching the film.
No. It's all right.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Wilton Estate.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Who's Brumby?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
Oh yes? How?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It never is.
Don't ask me.
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Making a living.
I have to. Things to see to.
They do that up North.
That's right, Harry.
Shut up.
...Polacks...
To get on the...
They came in and they, you know...
Eh?
You get a bad month, all of a...
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
...cower in his boots...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
Yes.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
That's right...
They...
When they...
What?
Someone should hurt them.
How?
Huh.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
No, we're just...
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Yes.
Well.  Well...
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
That's right.
Have I said that?
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
I...
Yes.
...and rob the place...
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Absolutely.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
You went for it.
So I'm making it concrete.
What do you care...?
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
They stole the...
What?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
Where was I?
No.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
Excuse me...
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Would you excuse us, please.
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
Murray said...
...they kicked out.
The leads are assigned randomly...
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
I can't do it, Shel.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
I can't split them.
Yes, I am.
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
What are you talking about?
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
You're so full of shit.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Mmm.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
What sales?
Only the beginning...
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Call up the bank.  I called them.
I'm sorry.
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
Mmm.
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
Like you taught me...
Yes.
Sure.
Which...
Me.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
What do I...?
Three days.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
The check wasn't cashed?
You tell me again.
She told me I have to.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
And the check is...
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
The...
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
 What?  You read it in the papers?
The children can stay.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
We're making an investment in Havana.
No.
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
What's that?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
It's the way Pop wanted it.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
Chi?
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
Yes.
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
It was a boy.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
Mike wants it.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
Very well.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
You would have killed his brother?
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Get out of my hotel.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
So?
I do not.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
You were unfair with them.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
No, she's here.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
The same assurance we got from you.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
Weird.
What's to be jealous of?
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
The Master is waiting for you.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Your wife?
Of course.  I am married still.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
But I didn't do this!
We have his note.
Mornin'.
Nice place.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
I stink to high heaven right now.
What?  Oh yes.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
What was wrong?
What's to sketch?
But why?
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
All right, I guess.
This David's a friend?
Can't today.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
Do you miss it?
How long were you...?
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
Do I look okay?
If that's okay?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
David produced her last picture.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
No.  Definitely not.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
But you said --
The Great War?
What happened?
I'm very sorry.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
Your friend?
What'd you say?
What won't do?
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Pray you, undo this button.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
I don't mind.
Quite.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Point-five ...
Yes ... Kip ...
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
A little family emergency --
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Needs brightening ...
Not at all ...
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
You know where the others are?
one minute -- !
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
Oh, for God's sake
Yes, sir -
You've been pre-booked...
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
What do you say, Toby?,
Damn crooks is everywhere --
What am I supposed to do?
You, too
Yeah --
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
I can handle it --
Me.
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
I know ...
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Thought I'd go for a ride -
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
For real?
Call 'em here -- ?
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
On account of me.
Hey -
Oh. Okay. Right.
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Cut 'em...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
And Tracy's on the move ...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Yeah ... You -- ?
What's that?
Of course. Hi, Junie --
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
No we don't -
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
So she flies -
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Shit all looks the same here --
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
What?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
How much?
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Jezuz Christ!
I can't do it anymore.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Where's the stuff?
I got seared.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
What?
It's been six months.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Nah.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
I can't make any more deliveries.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
Yeah.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
Oh shit.
All right, then.
What are we gonna do up there?
Why not?
Gone.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
Ah, history I think.
You caught that, huh?
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
Shut up.
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
Good, it was all right.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Seven.
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Fuck do you want?
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
I think so.
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Find out what?
Yeah, cured polio.
I did.
Tom.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
I think so.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
Now wait a minute--
--Gerry--
Hold on!
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
"Undermine?"
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
285.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
--Well, maybe that means you.
You've never been out of Boston.
I don't know.
Hence, the word remarried.
No, I don't.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Yeah.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
That's right.
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
You're kiddin' me.
I guess.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
It's not your fault.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
I'm Will.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
What?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Not a chance.
I'm supposed to understand this.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
They don't come over here that much.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
I guess so.
Like me?
So, do you play the piano?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
I never cared about that.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Don't hold me so tight.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Okay. Go on.
What's it to you?
Which way is House 25?
You got dances too?
Crate fell on me.
Why, you're the preacher!
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Just around that next bend.
I ain't gonna run.
You're right!
I dunno. Payin' five now.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Can't you see that sticker?
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
California.
No plants.
Okay. I be back a little later.
No'm.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
Don't taste bad.
That's right. And douse some in it.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
No.
Granma's dead.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Then what, Tom?
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
California, here we come!
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
Man bones?
I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
I'm Martin Blank.
Wonderful.
What?
Really...? So what?
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Where have I been?
Yep.
As long as I get the laugh.
What?
Yes.
No.
Get the fuck outta here.
You're a government spook?
Jesus Christ!
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Come on.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
We're both professionals, Oatman.
You understand the psychology of the job.
Up on the right.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Hard to get good help these days.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
In Portugal, yes.
I don't think so.
No...
That's going to cost.
I'm not happy.
There's nothing to be done about it.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
That's wonderful, Mom.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
Paul?
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
See you in ten years.
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
To shoot you. Correct.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Feel good?
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I am comfortable.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
I don't care.
I didn't know I had to.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
Don't they believe in signs here?
Hi.
You already did.
Why? There's no food in the house?
You're right. Good.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
I said... I started.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Go ahead...
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Yeah. Bye.
Tch. What are you --
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
Why?!
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
She will if you think she should.
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Night.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
Let's not talk about that now.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
You want to take a walk with me?
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
No. He had the choice.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
You!
You know her?
We should be fine, then.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
I don't think Warren would go for that.
She's an editor.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I know where he goes.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
No!
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
No, not yet.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
I know. Amazing.
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Now that's cool.
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
The sensitive type.
That's far out!
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
I'm gonna hit you!
Difficulty rating?
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Mm-hmm.
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
Hmmm.
No. No one special.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Never heard of you. Done anything?
Burn!
Yeah! Sure.
I said give me time.
Yeah?
I'm sorry, I can't.
I didn't know what was on it.
I'll make it up to you!
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Yeah.
What?
Yeah.
You would have looked better.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
I think we've got something.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
Joey, Joey...
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Congratulations.
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
Thank you.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Real charmer.
All right.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Okay sure. What about?
This morning.
You don't owe me anything.
We've been better.
Michael Myers.
What does that mean?
No. You son of a bitch!
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
It's okay..it's okay.
About what?
I can see this is useless.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Got it Earl.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
I don't want to.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
Yeah, hurry up.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
I can't.
Dad, what's going on?
Don't you mean what you do best?
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
He's here, Sheriff.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Huh?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
Why did you hang up on me?
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
Bye.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
I can't.
No, he's not.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
He isn't a man.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
I don't like that story.
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
There is no such thing.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
What did he look like?
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
I promise.
I killed him...
Will you get her for me?
What did you use before?
Only minimum security.
What does that mean?
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
And then, uh, April...huh?
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Right.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
What time do you get off?
Oh, okay.
Like what?
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
I don't know exactly.
What are you doing here?
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Ohhhh!
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Oh, God.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
No, I don't have time.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, he's just adorable.
What do you expect me to say?
Not because of me, I hope.
Poor Hannah.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Aren't they great?
I know!  I know!
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Are you angry with me?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
Leave me alone, can you?!
Yeah.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Jesus...Jesus!
Hello?
Like what?!  What?
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
Huh?
He's fine.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
...from Mavis, also.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Well, I just came from an audition...
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
How?
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
You're grateful, but you resent me.
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Yeah.  Me, too.
I remember you.
Yeah.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Come on.
Oh.  Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
God.
...which I did not get.
April?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
Say it in English.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
Then I'm doing fine.
What's up...?
Impossible.
Not with any certainty we...
...Let's see the pigs, please.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Show me the Pigs.
Have the child taken to bed.
The children...?
I've never heard that he...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
Try Barney Clark.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
....what...? 
Let the girl go.
You seen John Brigham...?
...what'm I looking at...?
...standard issue...
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
That could be.
You nervous...?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
I said sometime it gets so...
How's your <u>child</u>?
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
...should love to correct your error. 
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
Why did you look at me that way?
...your <u>scar</u>..?
I have had the honor. 
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
Where do you live?
She my foster.
We got KittyKat...
Sir, with all due respect....
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
Spoken like a Protestant.
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Why?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Hey, lost again.
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Wha-at?  What is it?
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
That wants to be a Yes.
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a child, would you hug her and say everything's going to be okay...
Ronnie!
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Hey, don't run away now.
Uh-huh.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Never say never.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Don't talk to me like that.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Give me the clipboard.
Give it up girl!
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Suicide is a private thing.
Sure.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
Next channel, darling.
Incredible similarity.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Of course.
Did not.
Did not.
I was just making it more special.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Goddamn Geek!
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
But my name's not...
What's that?
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
sighs.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
Love, you can still write to each other.
hurries over.
gives her a sympathetic look.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
Saint Mario!
You're such an incredible woman.
What??
That idiot boarder?
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Mummy!
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Your insight is enlightening.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Second most common?
You just made that up.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Yeah, how's that?
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Ambrose. I know.
Zero's a number right?
How many zeros was your wife worth?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Uh... eighty two?
What?
Really? Why?
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
Wow you are out of it.  
This game is over do you hear me?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Try stupid.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
Right.
Allen?  He... he's okay?
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
How recently?
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
Lie, you mean...
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
Bodybuilding!
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
She's talking to him now.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
She can't quit.
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
Never reach out!
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
He's pretty... remarkable.
What about?
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
Why are you mad at each other?
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
What?
Huh?
Oh -- great.
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Did you lock the garage door?
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
Philip!  The senior partner?
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
I'm having the floor fixed,
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Grow up, Dreyer.
What about cable?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
Get on the other side of that.
Even cosier.
Not now.  I'm busy.
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
What is it?
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
I think it was England.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
It's circumstantial.
No.  I don't scare easy.
No.
Is that it?
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Most people are afraid of death.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
Can you really tell from doing that?
She's a treasure she is.
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
The past?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
Why not?
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
I remember you.
Are you a cop?
You got me.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
Not unless they're immortal.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
It will end tonight.
Conner?
What?  How?
How could they get by him?
I don't think it is a duplication.
This cannot be.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
I can take care of myself.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
I'll make the call.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
It's happening right now.
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
I'm not going to die for this!
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
How about the cop?
I'm here.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
It won't be a problem.
Okey-doke.
What do you mean?
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
Yeah.
Where is it?
You'd better be kidding.
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
Be quiet!  Listen!
I know.
I don't drink beer.
How about dog shit?
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Just one question.  Please.
Another minute.  Please --
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I thought they locked you in your room.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
No!  They're right here --
Yes.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
I'll be back.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
How many in your family?
What's happening?
Canadian Club?
Their people?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
And what will they do with these satellites?
The police are very busy.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
I'll be over.
Today.
No.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
Listen, you need me.
How so.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
At least.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
Call, sir?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
What?
One thousand francs.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
I will give you my house.
Of course.
Please, be quiet.
We must do something.
Jean Baptiste!
It will do just fine.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
What about us?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What sort of car?
I want to know.
Paul! Then another voice.
We are almost out of everything.
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Many times.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Thank you, sir.
When?
Thank you, Roger.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Go downstairs, I will help you.
I'm confused.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Not at all!
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
Ms. Marr!
-- what was he doing here?
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
-- fuck you!
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
Left, goddamnit!
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Poor Mr. Price --
Up here --
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
Let's try down here...
It's succeeding!
So where's the party?
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
Steven??
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
My wife. Where were we?
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
I can't remember at the moment.
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
-- my loss --
Something with the power, I don't know!!
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
-- confirming everything we already know --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
I can't comment until I get paid.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
Over here.
-- I'm coming --
What will they tell you?
A few years older, perhaps.
That poor little girl.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
By killing them?
I don't understand.
No it won't - no it won't!
Yes.
Ok...
We'll get it later.
I'm ok mommy.
Where is she now?
Take me to her.
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
For good luck honey.
That's great, honey.
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Daddy help!
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Whatever you say.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
What about keeping an open mind?
Are you ok?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
Should I...
What?
We're not going.
No...  NO!
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Did you know her very well?
It was a shame.
So what should we do, father?
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
What are you getting at!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
And what would you do?
What?
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
And what did you discover?
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
So where is it?
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
What happened to him?
Where?
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
That's great.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
Who's that?
And he still sits there?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
You re not thinking of going to...
But I said I was sorry....
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
You sound disappointed.
Why not just go now?
Don't worry, we'll get it...
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Yeah.  The big E.
A little petting is not the issue!
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
God go with you, sister.
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
That's what you theenk.
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Prison?
Oh, I'm so sorry...
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Actually he never told us what it was.
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Like a "cat", one could say.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
What job?
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
Tell me about it...
The Dancing Dingus!
With a little jazz.
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Yeah.
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
I myself --
Why yes, do you know it?
-- or lack thereof?
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Now, Aim --
Now, Aim --
Oh Norville, I --
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
He grins wolfishly.
Says who?!
Tell me about it.
I'm sure you do.
...Geez.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
I --
Yeah, but, buddy --
But, buddy --
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Well, why don't ya read it.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Oh my God, sir!
Damnit, where's my car!
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Old Faithful.
She is!
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Alive?
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
Yes.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
Is she a doctor?
It's my day off.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Good morning.
I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
I love Fort Holland.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
Help me? How?
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
Yes.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
Why?
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
I wasn't star--
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
So early?
Hmm. Good night.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Stuffed and baking.
You go dry off now.
What do you mean?
Elena, what are you're talking about?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
In the car.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
All right.
Hnnn.
Stay out of trouble.
Birth control.
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Good night kiddo.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
You're not a psycho!
Yes.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Tell Sandy? What?
Then why'd you come after me?
I don't know.
Wendy!
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Greetings, Charles.
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
What's that, then?
What's the D.A. got them on?
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
I had him!
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Okay.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
First I need a copy of the key.
What?
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
Seven years.
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
Huh?
After that she left the party to go to him.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
Best friend?
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
Who?
What was it?
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Yes.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
No back-up.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Surely you know the one who made you...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
I didn't realise.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
It will grow back again!
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
He'll never let us go.
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
And you never cried -
Not yet.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Yes, and very beautiful.
So you felt it too!
Yes...
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Fascination...
But how do you know?
I can't.
I don't pretend to know.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Lestat, what do you mean?
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
That's all past, Lestat.
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
I tried...
You have it...
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
You're not lying to me, are you?
He did it to make you stay with him!
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
No...
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
No.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Yes.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
Come on, you can make it.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
You know me to well.
Who?
I told you.
I don't know.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I'm fine.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
To get out of Southport?
I'm okay.
What?
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
It's in my room!
He's in it with Willis?
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
So why are you still here?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
May life be good to you both. As for the others 棗 they will be quiet here 棗 and I will be with them.
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
My friend -- what can one say --
This was once a cemetery.
I think not.
No one can take my father's place.
On my word! That's what they believe.
I don't know now without my father.
What an odd question!
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Miss Wollsten!
You were father's secretary -?I never thought - -
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect 棗young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
Really, this is idiotic!
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Miss Wollsten -?my secretary, she'd know.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
How did she die?
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
Listen to what I say --
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
It is for that he hates me.
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
What did . . .
Carter 枛 bank examiner.
Well, who are you, then?
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
Our clothes are dry.
It isn't me!
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Oh, well, I can't . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Sit down? What are . . .
Well, naturally. Of course.
George Bailey.
No!
Yes, but George . . .
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Thanks.
Looks like we'll have to send someone down 枛 a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Well, what happened to you?
Give the flower a drink.
Will you try to get some sleep?
Uh-huh.
Zuzu 枛 Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Goodbye, Sam.
No charge.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Oh, George.
No. No.
Okay.  What's yours?
He's pretty young for that job.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Have a good time, son.
Very funny. Very funny.
Say, where's Mother?
She was here first.
Huh?
It's important.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
How do you do.
Right down here.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
This way.
They're not my children.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
You like it? I'll send you a box.
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
I'd like to do that.
What is it 枛 a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
I'll take chocolate.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Neither am I.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
In that place?
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Tuesday.
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
Well, then, sit down.
Left them at the office.
Going up to see Zuzu.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
I've eaten.
Huh?
You going to the lighthouse?
How fast is enough?
So's mine.
I'm supposed to.
Someone pop your balloon?
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
I think we're changing course a little.
Good.  It's terrible.
Yee-hah!
That's awful.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
We're hung up on something.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
We'll take your supercargo.
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Want to swim home?
You bet.  Hang on....
Over here!
The rope!  The rope!
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
Happy to do it.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
You can't stop me.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
Every day?
Yeah?
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
You said something about a camera.
Did you get any pictures?
What else you got?
Me neither.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
You don't make enough.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
So there's one around here.
What're you guys doing today?
For me?
Terrific.
That's great.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Just one minute....
It's still a good idea.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Great.
Waiting for Andy.
Maybe.
Ready?
Help!  Help!
Who'd you ask?
That's a crock of shit.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
3:30.
What's that mean?
Nope.
Double nope!
Mike?  Our Mike?
Anything?
Power line.
Is there something I don't know about?
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
I love it.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Might as well.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
What the hell is he doing?
So?  So?
With those camera lights and...
I guess.
Don't forget you have your brother.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Get out of here!
Take a deep breath and hold it.
Yes.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Nothing.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Up.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
Yes.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Okay.
... Mean through the tubes?
... He ought to put him in here.
I have to get out of here.
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
It's a shark's tooth!
I don't understand.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
Who's going to do it?
Michael, you're not going down there.
But you --
Only to myself.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Get ready to go.
Brian, he's coming around!
Thanks to you.
They still seem nervous.
Ten minutes ago.
Not good enough.
How you doing, Kelly?
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
Are you really?
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
I don't know, what else is there?
The one that goes underwater?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Now what's this do?
SEAN!
Don't you dare.
It's disappeared.
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
It's large enough...
Five hundred yards.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
Right, Mike.
Sharks???
He needs a haircut.
Something wrong?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
I have work....
They're at the beach....
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
I'm not on vacation....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
You check it....
He heard that.
I won't....
It's too dangerous....
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
Mommy lets me....
I'm still five....
Good night, Daddy....
You guys must be starving....
What?
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
I'm fine....
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
No one does till they learn....
It's wonderful....
Nothing....
That's hard to imagine....
Won't you get in trouble...?
My vision is perfect....
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
Good news travels fast....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
It needs more time to charge.
We'll be done pretty soon....
She's a tough lady....
Oh, boy....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Put me down, damnit....
Where the hell's the beer...?
What?
Gave them the day off....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
When we got the grant....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
So did I....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
I didn't ask you to....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
I've got to get to her....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
Here it comes....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Is it your vehicle?
I hope I'm not intruding?
"Welcome to Eureka."
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
It's a method for quitting smoking.
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Maybe?
How'd you do it, old man?
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Thank Christ we got a witness.
No, you didn't.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
You want me to stop the car?
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
Hey ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
<u>You</u> put it in there.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No, it has a mind of its own.
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Do you pray?
Why does he want to kill me?
Then why didn't he kill me?
I wanna be near you ...
The man from the F.B.I.
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Ask him.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
I know about the bachelor party.
Okay, this is working.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Oh come on --
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Oh, tell the story.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Sure.
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
Mission... statement...
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Happy. He said "happy?"
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Tell me -- let me help --
You want...
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
He's in the living room asleep.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Said who?  Sugar?
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Okay.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Call me tomorrow.
Very much.
Uh, not today, but --
Great word.  Towel?
Forget it.  Forget it.
Rod, get on the camel.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Damn right.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
How sad --
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Don't be silly.
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Dick.
-- and I'll get 'em.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Funny.
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
It is truly, what抯 the word? Inspiring.
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Just drop it Paul!
Eric...
Eric!
When did you have it last?
Think.
You couldn't have made that jump.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
You mean it?
I would completely support that.
How low?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
What about Eric?
He loves you too.
I thought you were an expert.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
NO!
Really?  What do you do there?
The last of my breed.
A well-accepted theory.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
Then we go home?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Something must've scared them.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
Back out! Move!
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
John . . .
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Come on!
What?  Why?
To collect my fee.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
The velociraptors.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
It has a broken leg!
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
Look!  Sarah!
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
Why should they?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
What?
Birdshit?
You think this is all a joke?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
No.
JUMP!
Where's Ian?
Can the kid walk?
Damn!
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
The door security systems are shutting down.
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
How would we cut off the lysine?
'Bout thirty seconds.
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Say again?
I know.
Not just every six weeks.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
They're not here.
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
And scary.
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Thank you.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Tim, are you okay?
Yes it is.
No.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
That's a good idea.
I doubt it.
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
Try to!
You want to talk about this?
The kids okay?
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Sure.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
What?
That was great!
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I really think we should go back...
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
So?
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
And if he's not?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
Up there.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
What was the matter with it?
-- Small.
I don't know what you could have read.
The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
No, I suppose not.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
-- Just doing our job.
Orlac is an account?
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Ludwig?
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
It's ... lovely.
I photographed it extensively, father.
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
Jack!...  Jack!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
They' re dead.
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
An ape ... some kind of ape.
That's your monkey, Denham.
Yeah.
Compassion.
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
Please --
I'd just be guessing.
Didn't want you.
No.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Yes.
My name's John Klute.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Mm.
Could I ask some questions?
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
-- OK?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
Mm.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
When?
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
We did this before.
I don't like getting splashed.
My bed.
What am I supposed to say?
How do you know how bad it was?
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Yeah.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
Two years ago? Sorry.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
She told me.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Did she talk about him to you?
Has she talked with you since prison?
I think she's trying that.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
What else do you know?
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Yes sir, we know he --
Not particularly.
The prospect of losing my child.
Detroit.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
What about your mommy?
Greatest...
Soon.  Very soon.
Wow!  French toast, really?
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Uh huh...
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's okay...
I'm allergic to onions.
No.
You mean for good?
No, she never did.
No.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Overruled.
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
I do not, your honor, however--
Then I have concluded my questions.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Objection!
Objection!
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
Eight, almost nine years.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
No.
No.
No.
Do you have a lover now?
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
You want what?!
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
What?
Beautiful.
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Kramer...
What?!?
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
Murray.
Right.
But it's not a year from now, is it?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
It's going to cost.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
How the hell are you going to do that?
Ten.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
I'm sure.
No.  I don't think so.
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
Yes. I am ready.
Khambas are wild men.
Again?
Cow.
I know.
But, I am in charge.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Here. We'll collect them.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
General Chiang.
Soon.
All?
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
I am afraid.
Then, we shall meet.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
I accept it. What is suffering?
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
Please.
I do not know, Holiness.
Look here!
Can India help us?
Britain?
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
I had relinquished doubt.
I will not go.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
I leave tomorrow.
Ahh.
Ahh.
We have.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
Oh, yes.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
No!!  Out!
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
You're crawling around like a--
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
We both know what they'll do.
That's actually the easy part.
I never had sex with you!
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
What?
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
Good.  See ya soon.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Excuse me?
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Night.
Ssssh!
You're mushing it a little around the--
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Look.
Okay.
Well...
You wouldn't?
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
Good thinking.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
You too.
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
I thought I saw...
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
<u>That</u> was a bust.
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
Look.
What?
Wait.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
Kelly--
Part of our research--
<u>Kelly</u>--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Backstabber?
Liar?
He's here, Ardelia.
Well, except for the one girl.
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
That wasn't me.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Jack Gordon.
Not yet.
Yes sir.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Murdered...? How?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Yes.
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
You're a tough one, aren't you?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I never thought about it.
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Who killed your patient?
Was it a butterfly?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
All right, then tell me how -
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
Early. Still dark.
What was it?
Yes...! They were screaming.
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
Yes...
Yes. I'll tell you.
You know I can't make that promise.
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
No fair! You lured him with produce.
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
How did you learn English?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
No. I will find you.
I have nothing to go back for.
There was no letter.
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
"Some"?
It can be dangerous...
He delivered no such message.
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
We were headed...
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
That's all, sir.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
And what is that?
Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Gifts?
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
This interview's over! The militia stays!
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
What?...
No!
Just get in yours!
How do you know it was Williams?
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
You screw around like that again and--
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Where's Jones?
Where's Doc?!
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
Do it.
Not yet.
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
...and a Russian grandmother...
It...almost got you.
Who cares?
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
He's tanking on us...
I'm going to kill it!
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
I ought to smack your face!
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
It's hit us all hard!
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Apart from those shotguns.
You get the guns?
Where're the others?
They were . . .
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
No Harry, you can't.
Jesus Christ!
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
All right, Dad.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
How about you? All right?
What the fuck is going on?
Out the back.
Invitations?
Hit the fuckers.
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
What do you mean?
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
Why, what's up?
I'11 meet you in the car.
A hundred grand.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
At what, exactly?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
Tom, you're all heart.
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
Twelve.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
Just shut up.
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
No, sir--
I'm sorry, sir.
I am, sir.
I do, sir.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
He'll live.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
He swore by it.  What?
So is Buddy on your short list?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
You're fired. You're outta the department.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
What?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Cool.
Made some money, came back here--
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
That's where he fell.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
That's right.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
We don't need a new jail.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
--Santiago.
Right.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
We have a murder?
Do you?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Hey, Sam.
Buddy Deeds--
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
He was killed.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
That was the night he disappeared?
For a while.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
So I've heard--
Are you okay?
Amado.
Yeah.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
What was your father's name?
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Yeah. It's quiet--
Hell of a spot to put a business.
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
Another woman?
You know who it was?
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
Thirty-five bucks.
They go together.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Right.
Why would I do that?
Deep shit?
I could scoop them out.
It was me.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
What is he?
He's with us... He's with us...
You don't?
Does that mean...?
When do you want me to start?
They won't tell you anything.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Why?  Because he had you?
That's my business. Harry.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
And they all came...
Quaid and Jennifer--
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
Hang on!
You can't.
I'm here, Harry.
Good.  There.  Yes?
Somebody killed him.
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
He got up and walked.
--vanished.
So could you walk on water?
What about Swann's miracles?
Mr. D'Amour?
We've never met.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
I don't think the dead much care.
A ticket home,
What for?  You need to stay busy?
No.
What's her problem?
Yeah.  You could say that.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Is that all?
And he didn't have them?
Yes.
He's better off this way.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
What?
No.
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
Two years.
Hi, Charlie.
No way.
It's Charlotte.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
Oh, she'll love it.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Working.
That's what you said the other night.
Hi, Bob.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Hello, darling.
That sounds great ?can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Good-night.
Bob?
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
It's just carpet.
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
That's ok.
Ok.
Bye.
Do you want I send it to your room?
One moment, please.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
It'll just be a few days.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
It's probably trivial.
Hmmm.
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
I found the pentacle.
What time did you make it for?
And how would you describe him?
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
It's nothing.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
I think I should join you.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
You ready?
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Something he said, just before...
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Father, I'm right here.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
How many weeks are you honey/
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
What?
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
That's true.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
Terrific.
It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
Whish the circumstances were different.
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
There weren't any voices.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Need any help?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
That's ridiculous.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Are you okay?
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
You're a caterer?
Really?  Well, come on, then.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Then I'll get you some punch.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Four days.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
Yeah, right.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I was just playing ball.
Just wanted to say good game.
What's up, Sidra.
Just like that?
Uh huh.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
Oh.
For how long?
I know this.  What do you want?
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
God, here we go.
I know, right?
What's up?
It happens, right...
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Nobody.
Not really.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Not for Quincy McCall.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Something was just missing.
We need to talk.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
What?
For what?
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
We still have to go?
What are you doing in my room?
I've been hearing you.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You know, people.
I mean, it's not true, is it?
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
What?
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Came by to check on you.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
No.
Brain and Lung.
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
baby, please, please --
LAPD. Open the door.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
Did you hear what I said?
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Okey-doke.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
What?
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
That was so great what you just said.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
I've got troubles.
please, what is it, please --
Yes.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
No.
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
What's up?
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
There's no asshole like you.
Twelve.
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
Mm. Hm.
Hollywood, mainly.
She's my mother.
He passed away.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
...are you Phil...?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
Yeah.
Uh. huh.
I don't think, he can't...
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Are you lyin' to me?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
Ok. What's your name?
I went out last night.
No.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
Then what?
All your other fluzzies?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I got in trouble at school.
I'm drinking.
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
It'll take the pain away.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Do you know the answer to this?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
I don't know what I've done.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
Hi.
mmmhmm.
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
Water.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
That's pretty cool.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Shut up -- shut up --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Hi.
Hi.
Yes.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
That is good.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Tomorrow.
Those can be adopted --
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
So what has changed?
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
Come on...
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Who?
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
How did you know -- ?
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
Your Majesty has had many women --
Thank you, your Majesty.
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
There.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Sire, I --
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
Oh Louis, Louis...
Yeah?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
And who are you?
She stole my car!!
And he took a swing at you?
And what did he do to the girl?
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
What did you do then?
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
I knew I could count on you.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Screw him!
Not with this...
Then what did you do, play canasta?
Where is he?
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
Christ!
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
When do they go to press?
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Somebody hurt him?
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
I am all right.
As long as they're dead...
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
What's one way?
To recover the mind set.
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
I'll pick you up in...
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
What?
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
He had to.
Don't talk to me!!
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Yes...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, God.
Yeah. It's right here.
No.
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Hi, Linda. ..
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
No. I can help you.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Blue, then.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
That's not true.
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
We don't know that.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
Huh?
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
You had disadvantages.
You're insane.
Yes.
What do you want?
No.  Caspiar.
George, I hate sitcoms.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
I refuse.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
What's up?
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
But it's only for thirty seconds!
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Hi... am I late?
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Okay.  You're probably right.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
You're a wimp.
You're a wimp.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
They're gonna lynch him!
Know what?
You all look the same to me.
Oh shit.
Oh, God.
Two grand.
If you get caught using that --
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
You killed them.
How many were there?
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
The agents --
What do you know?
You could say that.
More important than what is when?
You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Of the Resistance.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Morpheus, I don't know --
Good.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
But what?
I'm not the One.
Gee-zus.
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
They're watching you, Neo.
What is the Matrix?
Why?
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
What?
Are you worried?
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
There has to be something that we can do.
I'm going in after him.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
I'm coming with you.
Do what?
Not yet.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
They're hacking his mind.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Duck!
Tank, it's me.
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
I'll be all right.
I don't know.  I lost him.
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
You sure?
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Be careful.
'And with your spirit.'
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
Should I slap him?
I don't like loading crates.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
Don't be smart.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
That bad, huh?
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Ok...that's it.
Fine.
Ok.
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
What do they expect you to say?
What was it?
Wha?
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Charlie...?
Anything specific?
What is it now?
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
I know...I know.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
The girls like it loud.
 Shut up.
I know...I know.
You could say that.
Friends of yours Michael.
Sure.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
He's coming.
Love that name.
And you could care less --
Who?
Of course.
That you've been to Susan?
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
He said he would be there with bells on.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Why yes, thank you.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
Me, too.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
Yours.
Don't you want to hear the details?
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
Thanks, Quince.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Yes.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
Good morning, Jennifer.
What?
Yes?
Are you?
It's so very nice to see you again.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Peanut butter.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Then why are you here, Joe?
Watch me do what?
Yes.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
Gay?
I don't know who you are.
I loved it.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
Then don't.
We know all that we need to know --
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
I won't.
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
Not at all.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
What do you mean?
That's what everybody says.
So can I.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
I wouldn't put it that way.
Just a manner of speaking.
Yes?
Not at all.
Say again?
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
And we're very grateful.
Thank you.
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
How's that, Quince?
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
You think Drew will go for it?
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
I am.  With you.
What were you going to say?
Raise away.
Then what will you say?
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
The fireworks are about to start.
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
Did I say something wrong?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
I think I know her.
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
Leonard.
Hi, Leonard.
Yeah?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Yes.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Tell me about her again.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Sorry.
What happened?
I have this condition -
Don't protect him.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Why not?
Well, that's me.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
I don't remember.
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
What's wrong with this one?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Teddy. Your buddy.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
I won't be happy until you leave town.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *

Why would I have a gun?
Recruit us to do what?
It's a rip and a hit.
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Tell them what you want.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
Two main players plus three.
Make it 35.
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Of course.
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
What'd Neptune tell you?
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
What kind of weight?
Nothing.
No.
As in...?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
And Jos? my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
What's your Miami PD badge number?
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
To recruit you.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
How will it stand up?
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Yeah.
What's it say?
Not French registry?
Jos?doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
Meaning...?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
You sure are a pretty lady.
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
What's that supposed to mean?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
What?
What?
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
You bet I do, sir.
Where?
How's your hernia?
Ziat!
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
I'll pay extra
...She was on the plane.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
A hundred grams.
He wasn't even in the car?
Billy!  Please!
What do you mean?
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Yeah!
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Yeah.
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Oh shit.
You can't take anything seriously.
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Who?
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
Shit.
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
No, you talkin' at me.
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Depends.  You got a memo?
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Nino, please...
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
I'll be late.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
What-
Jump in.
Gross. What is it?
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
What is it?
No shit.
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
--my number one fan.
Following me?
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
It has no nobility.
Then the roads are open...
My daughter must be going nuts.
Well, I hope you like it.
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
Annie, what's the matter?
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
--cliff-hangers--
I said that?
A toast?
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
You really think so?
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Be my guest.
Three more chapters to go.
I'm glad you like it.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
What is it?
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
He's your client, huh?
You think he might be missing?
Maybe you can, Libby.
So do I...
You're still a writer.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
To do what?
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
And you're happy about that?
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
More like two-two point two million.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
I'm not ready!
Right.
Uh-huh?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Do what?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
Ethan Hunt.
Damn, you're beautiful.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Then feel better!..
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Yes?
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Just about..
Affirmative.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Ethan, tell me -
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Yep.
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
She must still be on the property.
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
S.O.P..
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
I don韙 know.  It didn韙 say on the tickets.
May take a little time.
We got it.  On your feet.
What happened to Jim?
Who is "they?"
You're sure about this?
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Of course - I韒 sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
One hour.
The arms dealer.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
About what?
Why don't you come back with me?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Always.
Just don't chew it.
Higher.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
They stamped it, didn韙 they?  Those damn Gideons.
Keep counting Claire.
I don't know.
Jack you're so wicked.
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
This wasn韙 what we discussed.
It韘 not working.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Thank you, Rose.
And that's how much I'm saying.
What's your news?
You did this once it didn't work out.
What killed him?
Maybe.
He did?
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
What are you doing here?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
Hurry up.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
I'm going to marry him.
I'm making you a steak.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
You think so?
I'm telling you your life!
No!
A wolf without a foot!
I was dead, too.
Take it easy.
What?
I'm in love with you!
I'll come to the wedding.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Come on.
I was.
No.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Is Johnny here?
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Johnny.
She was too young for him.
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
I shouldn't.
This is a good suit.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
You have a brother?
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
Pop don't like Johnny.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Where's pop?
It was a miracle.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
What sins have you to confess?
You should think about this.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
Where is she?
It's late.
You're kidding?
What happened?
That woman was a student of yours?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
I knew she had it.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Through ... We found them.
What do you mean?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
NI!   NI!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
No, no ... not "is"!
'Tis but a scratch.
I've had worse.
Had enough ... ?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
My liege,  I am honored.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.

How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Who did we lose?
Well ... I AM king.
Yes.
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Farewell, Concorde!
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
What - the curtains?
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
What is your name, handsome knight?
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
Please ... we are doctors.
Back to your bed!  At once!
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
Not down south you don't.
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
The good-looking one.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
I'm getting dressed.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
I can't move to tidy.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I'm flattered you think so.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
Out of my way!
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
It is quite late enough.
And that is my last word on the matter.
How will I know what she requires?
That's not good enough.
Aye, do.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
Quite.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Why do you think I keep her here?
Aye, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
What?
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Yes, ma'am.
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Oh, several things.
Yes.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
I hope he got his mother's permission.
To know when he'll be king.
Yes.
The same, your Majesty.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
What's the question mark?
How do you do that?
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
What the hell are you talking about?
It's twelve-thirty!
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
No way.
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
What?
I was afraid you'd say that.
No I'm not...
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
Is that your question?
You have no time.
That's impossible.
Sign me up.
The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
I'm going home Cynthia.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
The Cowboy??
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Sure.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
How's that?
One.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Well, I ...
May I have your name please?
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
I don't know who I am.
What do you mean?
You don't remember anything else?
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Okay.
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
What is it? What do you see?!
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
This Denny's.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Find out who they are?
Interesting.
Damn, that's a long drive.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
Why should I ?
I'm leaving.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
Not listening !
We drown.
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
I work here, remember ?
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Are you hunting wabbits ?
Knock yourself out.
Got it.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Sir ?
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
What did you hear ?
No I am not.
I'm listening.
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
I think I'll see hat action.
How can this happen ?
Thank you.
Excuse me, gentlemen
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Thanks.
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
What ?
We made it !
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Who was that guy anyway ?
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
What about giving the other guy a break.
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Pommeroy.
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Seriously?
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Of course.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
What??
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Thanks, I needed that.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
Maybe he's hungry.
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
It's just a corpse.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Hi.
Then I have come to the right place.
O.K. Thank you very much.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
I want juice!
MOM!
TAXI!!!
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
He is one of the great poets.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
DON'T, come on!!!
Owh...
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
And you'd be my cousin?
Good. I mean...
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
Was Rose.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Oh...what's that?
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
You know how I feel about you.
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Is there milk in them already?
Well you've gotta be prepared.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
He is?
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
Vada!!
Good for you baby.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
I'm impressed.
Yeah, all right...
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
What Hurts Vada?
I think it's still available.
Yes they are.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Oh that, she just likes to play.
I'm sure she will.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
Okay.
What's that?
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Did she ever see Vada?
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Perfect.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Dad?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
I love this guy! 
What?
You never cared before.
Can I go too?
Sorry.
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
There were just too many of 'em.
Get away, get away!!
Are you sure about all this?
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I wrote a poem too.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
We'd love to hear it.
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Yes it is.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Thomas?
No, I'm divorced.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Hi.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Liverpool?
Hi Mr. Bixler!
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Come on, it's fun.
What?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
So?
You're right, let's knock it down.
But I have my clothes on!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
I wanna live with them too.
I don't like her.
He likes her better than me.
Then go home, baby.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Okay, okay.
Well, let's spit on it.
Would you think of me?
The wandering sportswriter.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
You've been working on this, huh?
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
Can you watch the road?
Which was the disqualifying factor?
... you hate weddings, you never go.
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
I've missed a step.
Ju...
... whatever is manly and independent.
That's entirely understandable.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
I need you.
Hate that.
What's next?
Endearingly absent-minded.
She finds him "personable."
Till the gas ran out.
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
It's more than that.
You've been the man in mine.
Me either.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
Well.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
It means a lot.
It's over.
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
And your point?
Shhh.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
That is so romantic.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
Well, if that's the way you f...
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
An so it is.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Grand Old Opera --
Don't feel that way, honey.
What?
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
Green.
She's going to rest now.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
He knows better.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Okay.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
What is a turkey shoot.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
I think we can do that. Come in.
Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
I'1l get your bag.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
I don't really know what you're talking about.
Do you carry door handles?
Next you'll be sick.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
When I was little, in church.
No, I don't.
He's a member of our congregation.
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
That's unkind.
What?
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
For him?
You're real favorites of his.
You're not.
Sleeping.
Out.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Just a minute.
No, we never did that
He ain't really new.
You always live there?
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
I see.
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
What...
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
Are we in a big hurry?
Yeah.
Don't stop!
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
What?
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
What?
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Aside from the obvious?
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
You made every day like kindergarten.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They actually apologized.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
That's my opinion.
Next week's episode.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Wayne Gayle.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Is that her real name?
Really?
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
Don't call my men assholes.
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
Out.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Okay.
Don't start no trouble, boy!
Like where?
Have anything in mind?
Where was your father born?
Okay, thanks very much.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Yeah, I been there.
You work around town?
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
What is it?
Take it easy.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Why did you?
'Been up north?
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
I'll see you later.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
What?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
He could live with us.
Yeah, that's so.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
You didn't answer my question.
Huh?
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
There's nothing to say.
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
Yeah, see you in hell.
'Bye, Jocko.
Who're you?
Wouldn't have known you.
'Don't sound so sure.
I heard you.
That's right.
Okay.
Okay.
She'll do.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
That's right.
Okay.
Hell, I'm just like him.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
Don't look like there's a right way.
'Musta knocked her up.
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
I understand.
I know.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
I ain't drunk, honey.
What's the matter now?
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
Of course.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
The Elders, mon...
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
It hasn't yet.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Jah guides us.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
We got problems topside.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
What?
No!... No...
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
I don't know. I don't know...
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
What's my end?
What?
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
A regular Fagan.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
Leave.
Nope.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy? If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Jos, that's not what we're --
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Very romantic.
Anita!
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Do I want to be crunched?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
But I'm not a penguin.
Yes, desperately.
Better than I...
Thanks. And what are -
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Oh I don't think so.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Don't look down!
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
When are you going to open your eyes?
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
But now you don't have to--
Why?
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Lock.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
Barrel.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Where?
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Who's Lisa?
Just out for a while.
What are you talking about?
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
What the hell are you talking about?
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Shut up, Grady.
How come?
Yeah.
Yeah?
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
What do you mean?
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Oh, Jesse...
There's nothing to figure out.
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
Hi.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
All of them.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
Thanks, Mom.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
I thought I'd wait for you.
That's right.  I don't.
Mom?
Can't it wait till morning?
Watching TV.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
I -- I think so!
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
It's an amazing gift.
You did it the other night.
A little basic, but nice.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Didn't get much sleep.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
With Hypnocyl?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
Doesn't matter.
I can do that.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
No...
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
What about Kristen?
And what are they?
Mary Helena.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Where...here?
I'm a vegetarian.
Night, night, Honey.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Really?
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Really, no.
No.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
She left me.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
No.  What's that?
You have a stunt bottom?
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
How do you think I'm doing?
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
What's the thing?
Nice surprise.
Yes.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
He wouldn't say.
The movie star?
In a depressingly asexual way.
Yes, I think that one may be.
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
No -- it's my 22nd.
Di Caprio.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Still, not sparkling.
What's your name?
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
The others?
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
No, don't think I do.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
So -- any messages?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
No -- you're right.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
Oh sure.  Of course.
Yes.
So?
What book?
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Mister Sefelt?
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Mister Washington.
Thank you, ma'am...
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Go on...
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
A vote is before the group.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
O-o-o-oh...
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
M-M-M-Mack?
No.
Ca-na-da...
Yeah...
Are they all crazies?
Wow! They're so quiet.
Yeah!
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
My feet hurt...
Lobotomy?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
What for?
No!
I don't trust you!
Sure, Mack...
No!
Hold it a minute.
Yeah, Mac?
No! I wanna go!
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
In what way?
I see...
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
I'm afraid not.
Time out!
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
I don't believe it...
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Hi.
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Big man!
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
I don't have any.
I'm sure you will.
After you, ma'am.
Tha's your problem.
Huh?
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Why, sure, ma'am...
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Is he one of the loonies?
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
So.  How do we get to Rome?
What for?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Yes.  We did.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Except possibly that.
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
Hi there...
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I'm in love with you.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
He's safe.
Does he love you?
You didn't answer my question.
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane?
NO.
What are you doing here?
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
Yeah.
No.  I just came by to apologize.
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Just since yesterday.
Yes?
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Is he married?
Is he gay?
I don't know, Kate.
He's a podiatrist or something.
I think he's having an affair.
But it's July.
You don't have a passport.
My God, you have...
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
Oh my God.  Where?
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
I know, but...
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
When you could've found one in America.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
You miss me?...
No, why?
Right.
No.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
He missed me.
Mania.
That's really romantic.
Thanks.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that?he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
It's a living.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Boss loader!
Yeah?yeah?I guess I do?but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
I could have been better!
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
I wish I knew, Edie, But?
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Terry... Terry... .
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little? I better get you home.
I only live up there and across the roof.
I am?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Listen?get this straight?don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
I just told the Father.
What I did to Joey.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley?and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened?I'm frightened.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
He's going to have to grow up too.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland?the Middle West somewhere?a job on a farm... .
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
I don't want to hear it in there.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
A question of who rides who.
What do you want from me, Father.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but?
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies?I'm on borried time.
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him?boy, I was ready that night.
Such as what?
Yeah?
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
Be sure they got enough water.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
Yeah?us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
Take it easy now, Terry.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Forty-five bills.
Gimme.
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this? 梩o remember them by.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I?
Nothing happened, Johnny.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
Listen, Johnny?
What do you mean?
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Go on, beat it!
Keep Charley out of this.
What are you down here for?to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Nothing is worth your life.
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
What can we do against them?
A symbol, Master.
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
It would seem so, Master.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
It would seem so, Master
Then cancel my order.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
You mean...!
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
She's coming with us.
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Shit.
Now you're talkin'.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Two hours.
Forty-five minutes.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
I saw Karen Sisco.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
In the trunk, yeah?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
The manager's door is metal.
Wait.  You not Adele?
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
No, I didn't know that.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
I'll need a last known address.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
There a problem, Foley?
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
In my bag, in the car.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
You'd probably tell me.
You have to be kidding.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Shit...
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
I can go to the bar.
Those guys bother you?
Love it.
It smelled.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
Where?
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
How many?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
For a time.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Like what?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
Oh...
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
Thanks.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
He's still married though, huh?
Oh, he's moved out?
You used to like it.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
I see that.
Not at all.
I didn't have time.
So?
I told you, he isn't here.
That's right, just me.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Well, I need that...
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Where the fuck is Foley?
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
You mean hiding them?
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
That's me, Sir.
You liked that?
Sir, I --
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
He did.
Power dive!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
I was grieving too.
Little less.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
You were more like brothers.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Thank you, Sir.
Bombers.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
We're all going away.
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Brilliant, Admiral.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
All of 'em.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
Good梑ye, Grandma.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
Pretty strange.
Good.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Is this slow enough for you?
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
I have to talk to you..
I just can't trust you anymore.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
It opens, too. Look inside.
I know.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Of course.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author ?fat, violent, drunk...
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
What are you shooting for?
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Can we split now?
What?
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Open it.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
For what?
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
What does Charlie think about that?
I'm just happy to see you.
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
Rosalie Testa!
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four梩hirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
I	know what a burrito is.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Wbat're you talking about?
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Pretty much so.
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
It's been a few years.
I'll be fine, Dad.
It sucked.
I'm not hungry.
Anywhere but here.
Zowie.
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
All the time.
You know everything, don't you?
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Andy?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
One hour!
I promise!
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Honesty is always best.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
We?
Continue.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
As in, the vegetable?
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
Rayisha. Very nice.
Not bad.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
Yes. On my torso.
You bet. We'll see you later.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Yes.
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
That's correct.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Duh...
Okay, Joe...
Yeah... ?
My lettuce is wilting.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
We ought to be suing him.
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
Jesus.
Charles...
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
Charles...
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Show me your eyes.
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
Saw something I didn't like.
Get out of our way.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
Don't do this to me....
Hey, who?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
For now.
Rain.
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Which half?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
So which one caught your eye?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Just the same, I want one.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
No.
What's so special about him?
Remembers what?
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
It's probably wrong --
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
Yo!
But how long is a day?
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Him.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Sustained.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Okay.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
Zira doesn't want your female.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
What?
He wouldn't leave her.
The Hunt Club.
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Read it yourself.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
I don't know.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
Taylor, you can't.
We can't.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
He doesn't know.
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
Says he can't walk.
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
I got one...
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Dawn...
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
I volunteered.
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
...there's nobody.
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
Thank you.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
As I said before...
That's putting it mildly.
Dance? Here?
They know you here--know your name.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
Killaine's wise to what?
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Yes.
A graduation present.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
I don't want to talk.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
Because you think your in love with me?
I'm not interested in blind dates.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
Got the information on you?
How's life treating you?
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
Did I do something wrong?
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
You get it's brother.
Open it and count it.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Not quiet yet.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Not if it clears the air.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
Why should I mind?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
I say YES!
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
Yes.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
Sit on that log, dear.
That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
Hello.
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
The Argies.
Come on.  Hand over.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Fuck off.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Hello.
Why not sit down and wait?
Voila!
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
Where?
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
I say when it's over!
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
I'm not FBI anymore.
Yes, sir.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
Figured you did.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
What?
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Something... in the trees...
No way, old buddy.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
We're going to need everyone.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
I'll take him.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
What's that, General?
He knows our defenses.
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
You've got a lot of nerve.
What's that?
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
The price just went up to ten.
No.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Off the boulevard.
Do you plan everything?
Oooh, thank god.
Why?
Just a romantic, that's you.
I sell them.
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
What happened to him?
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
I more than liked it.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
You just did.
What do you mean?
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
It was good.
Vivian...
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
I'm here.
We're letting them slide?
Yes...
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Let him answer.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Kit!  Where've you been?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Where do you fit?
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
I pray for that.
Do I!?  Momma!
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Kit give me nothin'.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
What if they serve soup?
Professionally?
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
I'm just looking, thanks.
'Scume me.
Do you remember me?
Yeah.  Thanks.
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
I think it's great.
I swear it will be done.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
You're a silly girl.
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
Well ... you were dead.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
Anybody want a peanut?
I thought I was going faster.
Yes, some of the time. 
How many could you handle?
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
But you don't know where he is.
Over the Albino, I think.
What?
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
I don't be-leeve this.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Do you want me to go on with this?
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
And our assets?
Light him.
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Hah?
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
Again. Thank you.
Then why are you smiling?
I ought to be after twenty years.
That would be inconceivable.
You're sure nobody's following us?
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
You know what a hurry we're in.
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
I smell nothing.
You've made your decision then7
Australia.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
I will. And I choose --
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
Have fun storming the castle.
Congratulations.
"Of the silvery moon,
"I want to croon,
Do the books!  Do the books!
I have hurt your feelings.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
To failure!
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
Liebkind, no!
What is it?
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
No kidding?
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Got dag pa dig.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Here I come, ready or not.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Oh, the best one.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
I shall count the minutes.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
By the sacred memory...
Wagner...
The Blue Max...
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
What have you done, LSD?
No.
What?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Someone is sitting in that window.
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
I don't need pills... just sleep.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
And the police haven't been able to...
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
What do you know about it?
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
She'll need both of us.
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Yes.
An hour! Or less!
Just wait here?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Well?
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
She always tries to be proper.
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
I'm glad we didn't.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Maybe you saw Mary!
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Leave me alone!
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
Do you have many patients, doctor?
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
I'm going to call the police.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
Yes!
A voice ...
That called ... commanded ...
Yes, the child ...
Yes.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
Thank you.
The body of Joan Gale!
You mean he was colored?
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
You give me a pain!
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
It's all yours.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Cry-baby?
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
You're insane.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
Where to?
That's the physicist's playground.
It's an experiment.
Well, I got to see her.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Nobody.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
What is it, Rose?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Well, some fiend might.
But Rose...
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
I don't want to know...
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Yeah.
Boy! Wow!
What are they doing, Doll?
Buddy, that was my place.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
She will succeed.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Who?
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, no, sir.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Yes, sir.
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Oh, yeah?
She has other things to do, Dave.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Illusions, Madam?
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
More history, Rose.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
You're not gonna see him again.
What and?  That's what I got.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Lay off once, would you?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
Follow me.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
Can't you say something nice once?
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
You can't be serious.
What?
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
Absolutely.
Don't crowd him.
Shit.  You're right.
No you're not.
You think this is so easy?
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Out here.  On your knees.
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Yeah.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
His lightsaber.
Luke!
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
That's all any of us can see.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Quiet.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
I will not fight you.
Your father he is.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Makes you cry
Like I'm outside in the rain
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
The delivery boy.
...Fine.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
I think it's closed.
By accident?
...I suppose.
I think he might be worried.
It's not that --
No, I don't belong here.
Do me another favor?
Could ya take off that hat.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
That so.
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
Fouls.
Very high an' very fast.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Of wa?
Does that bum have to say that?
Move your shoulders down.
No wine.
Why?
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Bob.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Black market?
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
...Thanks.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
I like yella teeth.
Why?
Yeah.
Spider Rice.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Damn! How's it look?
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Looks, huh?
Maybe ya better forget it.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
What can I do about it?
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
Well, I'll be...
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
What the hell's a freeway?
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
He's right here in the...
Eddie, come on.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
So what do you want me to do?
So's the job.
That was the idea.
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
Divorce?  Never!
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
My brother.  Get inside.
Yeah?
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
From this box here...
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Why, what is Tybalt?
The what?
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Young Romeo is it?
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Amen
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
Of course.
And I don't believe you...
And who are you?
Which leads us to...
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
That's him.
You were a soldier, were you?
Duty calls?
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
I think not.  After you...
Not so fast.  Who's that?
Bad company...
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
I swear...
I sent it to myself in Paris.
It's done.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
You seem one to me.
Is that right?
My way is better.
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
Did he bring that with him?
Who's they?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
No thanks.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
Jujitsu.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
You were smoking?
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
A lot of people died.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You see the bullet?
I know of him.
Yes.
It's my job.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Dark ops?
Very ugly.
You think?
Right now?
So I do it.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Why not?
Finish the job...
Finish it!
What of it?
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
You sure?
Gonna be tough.
Seamus Reilly.
I'm alright.  And you?
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
I don't know what you're -
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Seven thousand...
Never heard of it.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Why?
Maybe.  Who cares?
I don't know.
What's that?
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
What are you gonna do?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
That's not what I mean.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
What are you thinking?
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
You killed him...
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
He killed her...
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Uh huh.
Rock solid.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
He's irresponsible.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
I don't believe it.
Could it have been this?
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Lingerie...
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
No, I can't say that I have.
Dammit you抮e persistent.  I don抰 want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Sort of.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
I don't know...
What?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Then what the hell are you all about?
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
And what happened?
You've done without it long enough, ma.
So someone did get away.
We're going to find out.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
This is your ship?
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
That's right.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
I am a tourist.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
I'm calling for back up!
Don't look at my ass!
And you ain't black!
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
What?
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
What?
What is it?
She's walking back towards the door.
There's people up here!
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
Fine by me.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
I did!
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
No problem.
New York City?
Some Kung-Pao?
No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
Any leads?
Thank you.
The police can protect you.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Yes, Master.
I know, Master, but...
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
This is pathetic.
Tell me about it.
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
We are both full of shit.
I know a shortcut.
No.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Don't go there...
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Come on!
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
The Feds?!
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
They put you in charge?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
It's okay. For restaurants.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Or somethin'.
Nobody touches me.
What are you talking about?
Do it!
Han?
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
I still have work to do here.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
I don't know.
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
No, I'm not.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
That must have made you proud.
Thank you.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Originality is my speciality.
You'll answer my questions?
Yes.
You have one?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Cindy the manicurist.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
You know, there's no...
Can you fix it?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I'd rather not.
I kissed him back.
So am I.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
It's something I've always wanted to do.
She's the boss.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
Where?
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Thank you, Dad.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
No.
Is there somebody else?
That's good.
So you're angry.  Big deal.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
Walter, I'd love to --
That doesn't make any sense.
And then I'll see you in New York --
What?
It's just like my grandmother's china.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
So what happened?
What?
About what?
I should say something in this about magic.
"I want to meet you..."
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
He said hello.
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
Okay.
I know.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
Yes, I did.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
What?
Mom, we already...
Sure you do --
The cabinets have to be redone --
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Have you had any relationship since?
I don't think I could really describe it.
Yeah.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Window.
I don't know.  Do I?
It's a spice rack.
It plays in 50 states.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
I know.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
There she is.
Okay.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
This is the one I like.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
What about it?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Well...
Microwave.  Five minutes.
What do you mean?
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
You did?
You could have called me --
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
You want 'em all arrested?
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Can be what?
I've had them since the day they were born.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
It's possible. Just negotiate.
I thought maybe you forgot...
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
What attitude?
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
No.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
I was talking to my wife.
Yeah.
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
How about in the house?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
You like that?
Everything go?
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
Nothing.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
I try.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
You can still work.
Ass first into the world.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
No. I'm good.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Hey, check it out...
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
I don't trust anybody.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
What does that mean?
Make me an offer.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Anything for a dear friend.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
Hey, I don't play that.
Pull your pants down.
Big Bill
What?!
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Jesus.
Yeah.
My name is Tom.
Answer the fucking question!
It speaks!
Yeah.  What about him?
To who?
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
What do you mean?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
I thought you were done.
...alright, let me know when.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
In West Fork?
You must be a hell a shot.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Cap'n...?
Like hell, you did.
I'd love to hear it.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Pass.
Where are you from, Captain?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
You don't count.
But, sir...
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Since when have things been normal?
Nope.
And what about your own hand?
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
I think you're right, Keith.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Sure, Reiben.
There's always a bright side.
Sure, what do you want to know?
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
Why's that?
ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
Here they come.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Yes, sir.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Who knows?  It worked.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Yeah.
What's a scam?
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
Come on, it's graduation.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
I dream about it.
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I love you dad.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Dad.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
I'm fine.
I like him a lot.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Yes, I...
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Yeah?
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Pardon me?
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Job?  Being a great date.
You think so?
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Right.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
You're shaking.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
No.
Just my dad.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Hello Lloyd.
Fine Lloyd.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Your car?
What?
What?
Yeah.
How you doin', brother?
You know Diane Court?
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
I love you too.
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
Good.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
What's going on?
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Yes.
Do what?
I think it's too late.
More.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
Would it do any good?
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
On national television.
Why would you wanna do that?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
What?
Did you do it?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
No, I don't.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
Enter Cotton Weary.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
The forbidden subject.
I'll get my jacket.
We抮e hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Miss Weathers.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
I think you're all an act.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Let's find out.
No, wait here.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Yeah, right.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
Just in case...
Dewey, there's no such place.
I'll give you one guess.
I'm everywhere.
It's what you want from me.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
Oh my God.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Don't do this.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
I'd really just like to be alone.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
But...
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
But...
Don't panic.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
I don't know.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Absolutely.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
What did you know about your mother?
What Rielly?
No.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Sid I can see you!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Always.
Someone stole Sid's file?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
But you know who she was.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Oh shit it's my cell!
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
There a story in that building?
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Who?
Yeah.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
Who's this.
Huh, fine.
Who's this?
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
Yes, sir.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
You sleep in THAT?
I'll only stay a sec.
Now that it's out of your system.
I'm going... I'm going.
What's that?
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Hey, hey, it's just me.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Are you serious?
What?
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
Are you alone in the house?
Who is this?
Really? What?
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
You never told me your name.
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
I'm getting scared.
No...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
Answer the question and I will.
Your call.
No, not yet.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
I don't think you're so bad.
Sidney's father?
Hold up a sec...
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
...yeah...
You're sure it was the Hilton?
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Afraid not.
Yes, sir, sheriff.
You think he could still be in town?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
Yes, that's right.
I'll send you a copy.
Forget it.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
Why would she lie about it?
And why would she do that?
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Hello Sidney.
No you didn't.
Twice.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
You got it.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
The why'd the police let him go?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
Why are you doing this?
Do they know who did it?
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
It's past seven.
Just like old times, ain't it?
It's alright. I'll get it.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
No, I haven't heard.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
I heard.
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Hello.
David... please...
NO!
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
I realize that.
For now.
No.
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
Tonight.
What about sports?
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Bear with me.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Yes we do.  Here...
What?  Assessing fines?
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
That part of me is dead.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
Big surprise.
When do we get to question him?
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
It surprises me.  It really does.
I'm sorry, I only...
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
Why don't you finish the job?
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
Dunno...Seems so.
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
How far's the river from here, Mose?
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
JOINT action?
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
What?
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
Not likely.
We won't be here...Come on!
What's goin' on?
It's what I'm countin' on.
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
From the beginning...
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Finish your breakfast...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
You crazy?
Only if I'm dead!
We got two around that age...
Come on, say it.  You know...
Oh God, Tommi...
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Oh, damnit!
We just have to make a new beginning.
So do I, believe me.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Hi, darling.
What are you talking about-
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
1976.  What happened back then?
I've killed my husband!
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
Tenth floor.
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
And the title of this piece?
It's good.
The title won't do.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Right you are, governor!
Yes.
Writer, is he?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Done.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
That's me.
Cut his nose off.
Partners!
Of course not!
Very well.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Who are you?
Every word.
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
As soon as I have found my muse
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Tomorrow
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
I don't know, it's a mystery.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty
There was a wager, I remember卆s to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
I have to get back.
A lowly player.
Oh--I am him too!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
I must. I must
That's my line!
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
and thus unable to declare her love
How does it?
You flatter, my lord.
I do not love you, my lord.
I will do my duty, my lord.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
My hat?
Do you understand me?
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
You are on my ground.
What?
About what?
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
I just thought we should discuss it.
Can we talk about something?
I want to talk now.
You think so?
I don't know.
There was a break-in.
You're sure? There's lots more.
We just wanted to speak to you.
Where do you think you'll go?
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Take another look at these two.
I see.
Well, yes.
Really?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
Just serve.
She hated you --
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
You're right.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Yes.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
I thought we all were.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Who?
Who was it?
He can't stay up there.
Your painful groin?
Where he can't get it?
You're frightened.
Alex.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
That's what I thought he said.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
You mean I can have the room?
Burglary?
Of course.
That wasn't a question.
Did you ever kill a man?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
I'm sorry.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
No.
No one. I promise.
No one.
You and me?
Yes, sir.
What happened to that guy?
That one, last week.
You must be Juliet.
Would you like to see the rest?
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
No.
A certain weakness.
You know about it?
That sounds fine.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Yes, but... I thought...
That you were just indulging me.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
What are you talking about?
My keys.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
I gotta talk to you.
But you don't know what happened.
What?
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
Whatever you say.
What about?
Why don't you see Lester?
Yes.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Nobody can hear it.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
No.
Hello.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
I am not like my mother!
Right.
They are?
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
I'd cut it...
Yeah... wow.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Did Lester know about him?
You did, I know you did.
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
What about it?
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
-- mmm --
-- you've got to leave.
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
No --
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
What?
Wanda...
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
-- how did you get here?
That's too bad.
Hey, stop by the shop.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
Well, like what?
I am?
-- Sure.
Great.
I want your feelings about it.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
What is.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Where did this come from?
-- no, it'll help me, really --
That's all you've got to say?
What did you say?
No?
Thank you.
I know what you mean.
... this doing hair it's...
I don't know what to...
Isn't that bad for it?
Well... who are those guys?
But...
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
No thanks.
I know.
No --
What?
No.
Okay, okay...
What do you mean?
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Is that right?
Steve?
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Aren't you going to have one?
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
George is great but I know what you mean.
I guess not.
But you have problems?
Well, you know what I mean.
Jackie --
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Honey?
That's right.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
No.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Yes?
Come here for a minute, first.
Yeah.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Try to think what it was.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
What about Room 237?
Okay, Mom.
Okay.  You behave yourself.
All right.
Okay...oh!
Yeah.
No.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Danny!
Oh!
Yes.
Yes.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Advocaat is it?
That's right, sir.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Grady... oh.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
What line of work are you in now?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Your money's no good here.
Uh...huh.
What time is it?
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Hmm, nice.
Yeah... that's all it is.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Of course you are.
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away from me.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Oh...
Well, it's very... homely.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Royalty?
Oh!
Oh, I'll say.
Sure, Uncle Al.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Jane, I have to talk to you.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
I told you!
There! You see!
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
You're not going to let it go, are you?
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
What you say?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Good evening, Vincent.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Oh-huh.
Yes, Betty?
Right.
Why?
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Am I?
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
You know that song?
Um, I don't really know this one...
I knew that.
Wet behind the ears.
Tell me about it.
Amateurs 2
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
Five a.m.?
Three years.  Sister.
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
You watch yourself!
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Keep moving!
Give me a C.  A C!
What did He say?
Your name?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Like to who?
No food?
My what?
And whom would you call?
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
I am?
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
I'm a Christian.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Get a stenographer.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
What?
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
I think they'd understand.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
You won't even tell us?
We didn't tell you what?
Not... totally.
Which one!
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Which convent was that, Sister?
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
Impossible.
She said they were from her old convent.
But where?
Many have.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
Excuse me?
I was afraid of this.
To place it inside its coffin.
What are you spying on?
A diseased monster.
... Brom Bones...
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Hmm?  See them?
A fine idea.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
The militia?
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I did not ask you to, did I?
The Western Woods.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
What happened?
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
You made this, and the drawings?
I insist that you have it.
It was not butchery.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
What?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
It was you there?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
His horse.
Yes, actually.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Let her go!
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
French-fried potaters.
Karl's my name.
They was a boy. We made friends.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
What?
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
I get nervous, that's all I know.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
I thought I told you to keep out!
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
I thought they was.
All right then.
Yeah, I recollect it.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
No sir.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
He ain't ever okay to me.
Did Vaughan go home?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
Yeah.
You better go get 'em.
I reckon.
Yes sir.
My history.
I didn't aim to.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Okay.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Can I help you, sir?
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Signs?
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
It's my birthday.
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
He's crazy.
Not a peep.
Ready. Any time you are.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Eighteen and a half years.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
Thanks for the tip.
And his parents?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
And?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
Just passing through.
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
Not a one.
What's your offer?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
How long have you been here?
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
What time did you get to bed last night?
His only copy?
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
It wasn't my fault.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Yes, please.
Carl Heine's type.
That's obvious.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Well, it seems to me...
Why?  We're only talking.
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
And the next one...?
And the last...?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Twelve.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Like you couldn't believe.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
Carl Heine came.
I have told the truth.
Won't take two.
Have a look.  At nothing.
No, you don't.
Fell.
Maybe...?
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Obviously.
I already said that, b...
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Why?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Get lost, will you?
Beat it, Buster.

A what?
I'll say.
No we're not.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
- Type O.
We're not too late, are we?
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
As far away as possible.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
And I'm Daphne.
Polish?
You tore it again!
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
He's going to be ashore with you.
I'm engaged.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
What?
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
I may throw up.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
We're not on the pier yet -
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
That's ridiculous.
What did you say?
You got some?
I'm fine.
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Well, I'll come back later.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Oh - here and there - and around.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Most of the time I slap it.
Why?
I'll throw up!
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Why?
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
Oh.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
You are?
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
Would you mind terribly?
My fault.
I don't think so.
Not at all.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
If it's at all possible -
What?
They repealed Prohibition?
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
It's the crews' night off.
Completely.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Nothing at all?
You mean you can't fall in love?
What happened?
You poor, poor boy.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
What is it?
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Thank you.
Did you have a nice time?
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Go where?
I never join nothin'.
I sleep with my spats on.
I already told you.
Spats Colombo.
You don't owe me no nothing.
There抯 finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Oh, shut up and be happy. It抯 always this or that. You抮e never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
What for?
Or Kat....
Why, with you.
I抦 not as square as my daughter thinks.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she抯 getting married.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Don抰 be ridiculous. It抯 late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
But, somehow, it was Kat抯 arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
And you do now?
No, tell me.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there抯 something not quite right.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Kat.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he抯 still crazy about you.
I don抰 know.
You抮e too good for him.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
A weekend?
I think that抯 disgusting.
I guess so.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Okay.
I disappear. It抯 not about me.
Show me.
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Not dollars. Pounds.
Oh, cut the crap!
Thank you.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Of course, don抰 be silly.
?..but it抯 getting there. ?
Is there any other way to take it?
At least somebody抯 using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation抯 most precious resource: your daughter.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
You don't live around here, do you?
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
Uh huh...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
Colored.
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
Yes, mam...
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
It was too dark, Daddy.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Mornin', Daddy...
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
September 4 -- how far away is that?
Goodnight.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Did you find your father?
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
I'm used to it.
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Might be...
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
Will they give him a trial?
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
I am the clitoris.
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Pillow.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
I saw him last night!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
How the fuck should I know!!
Okay.
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
What?
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Help yourself prickfuck!
Norwegian Ass Raper.
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
Hey, Chef.
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
What?
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Dude, what the hell is going on?
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
MOM!!!
FREEZE!!
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
We can't leave without you!
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Yeah...
How do we do that?
What's the difference?
Totally!
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Yeah, so what do we say?
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Yes?
Right away, ma'am!
Oh.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
You bet, Terrance!
Terrance! NO!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
And ze rope?
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Oh yeah...
Anna...
They're not going to make it!
It can't be.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
Well it's a good thing that I did.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
I know, I know.
That's right.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
You're right.
Close every door behind you!
So we did.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
You too.
Over and out.
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Try not to think about it.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
That is one of my priorities.
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Can I get you something for the road?
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Wait! That's an aria!
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Theo.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
I'm your blood.
You got a better offer?
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
I found dad.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
No!
You know who I am?
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
What ever happened to just bowling?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
They suspended me.
Where can I find him?
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Coming right up.
Won't your father help you with that?
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
The mental hospital.
So, what about you?
Plan B is your dad.
I could let them go for ten.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
It's Junior, isn't it.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
I feel sick.
At least I'll die smiling.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Please, Dr. Levine.
I said back away.
How long will that be?
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What if it attacks?
What?
Hold on --
It doesn't make any sense.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
What's wrong with oxygen?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I don't know.  That's the point.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
She should've known better.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
-- and then brought her down here --
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Pull it.
They've left, keep watching!
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
What's the message?
It's not ignorant.
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What is it?
Radiation shield, you think?
What do you make of this?
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
To what?
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
Too big?
What sub?
I love secrets.
Underwater?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
What?
Where did you get this?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
You did, didn't you?
Why should I go?
You don't trust me?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Fixing it.
The refridgerator.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
Manifested?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
But why is he doing it?
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Bingo.
You want to kill him?
Where are you?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
No, he isn't.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Don't you know?
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
I --
C'mon --
For whoever's in that thing.
Another attack?
Like what?  I'm not --
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Am I?
Then what, Norman?
Harry?
But why would she -- ?
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
You got her?
No idea.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
The others, sir?
What report?
Huh?
Who's everyone?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
The creature?
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Don't be so supportive, honey.
What?
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
This isn't a game, you know.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
Could I learn to feel it?
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
I'll make a report later.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I read you sir.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Death to all bugs !
What's the hurry ?
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
I'm getting better.
Only when I give you an order.
Hey, check it.
So who's got time to get married ?
I have good reflexes.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Why not ?
How do I know if this is love ?
Good luck at the academy.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
I can't help it.
Who cares ?
I'll go for that.
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
Alright, I love you.
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
That was just a mix up.
What happened to your eye ?
How are you, Carl ?
See you on the bounce !
We've gotta go get her !
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
AAAAAAAAAAA !
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
No, sir.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
V'ger is that which programmed me.
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
<U>Answer</U>!
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Permission to speak freely, sir?
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Hold relative position here...
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Any reply from them?
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
There is no alternative.
The point... 
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Annie...got an umbrella...?
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
I need a typewritter.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
What's it called?
Yes.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
As the Old Mill goes around...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
...I always thought so...
Yes...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
You're still here.
I love your script.
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
Well, first, you got to change the title...
Better idea...
"Room Service!"
I don't drink.
One moment.
The other side.
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
It used to be the Old Mill.
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
<u>Please</u>...
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
What?
It does?
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Yes, that's right.
That's so beautiful...
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Who is this person that you've found?
No.  Don't tell me that.
We'll work it out...
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
And I need a drink.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
What'll I do for fun?
Nothing happened.
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
You have to what?
There's other things to be learned.
Mr. Bailey.
Who is it raped you?
Then what is the...?
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
Why?
But we...
Oh.
I...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
I...I...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
...yes...
Yes.
We, we have to give it.
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Marty...
That isn't very nice.
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
You said <u>three</u>...?
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Sure.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
I can only write on a manual.
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
You want me to lie.
The girl was in the car.
I didn't say anything to them.
I don't know.
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
They're coming Fedex...
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
...it is?
Yes, I hear it.
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
I live.  In the same country.
What are you gonna talk about?
Secret's safe with me.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
She is but an arriviste.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
This is my daddy's house --
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Why don't you say hello?
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
You owe me a quarter.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
Then have a donut --
No!
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Mom...?
Before you.
You dying.
Every day.  More and more.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Have you still never told him?
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
We're not discussing your age.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Easy enough.
Not to me.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
WE are over.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
But it's not on the schedule!
Look, I...
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
...it's my problem, too.
You're not dying.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Brad Kovitsky.
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
And her...?
Don't be too sure.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Worked.  Like a charm.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
You weren't passing 'em out.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Yeh, it's cheaper.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
I trust you of course I do but --
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Rache, get out of th...
I think so...What do you think?
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
What if he is?
What?
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Four brothers and five sisters.
No.
We had to work. My family was poor.
Mi Jesus卪i jesus?
My Jesus?
My grandchild-baby.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
Yes, I do. I love them!
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Yes, Mikey?
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Thanks.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
OK!
Gee, you're home early!
Uh huh.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Say, Ni...
Say, 'Nigger.'
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Any books you like to read for fun?
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
Hunh.
Yeah, sure.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Yeah. I know.
So where'd you get in?
But what did you get on your SATs?
Sure卽m厃eah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Oh.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
There's the fence...
Because I'll be firing at them.
Like where--in your dreams?
Yes, you should.
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
He's in there...
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
What the hell is it, anyhow?
What!
Richter-we got a problem!
Excellent...excellent!
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
We can't--it's power driven!
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Moffo!
Don't be ridiculous.
At his office in the Capitol.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Oh, yes, that's right.
What?
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
General Schmuck?
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
No, sir.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
This is General Ripper speaking.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
A shooting war!
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Plan-R????
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
How many planes did we lose?
Maybe it's an exercise.
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Call them every five miles.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Ready, Major.
Primary arming switch.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Primary trigger switch.
Seond safety.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Like hell it does.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Sorry, King.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
But I get a red light.
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
Knock yourself out.
Yeah.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Was it okay?
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Oh.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Look.
Come on.
Really?
In what way?
Alright, Pony!
I can come visit?
I will.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Please.
No, no, whoa!
I could.
A reel?
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
It's nice here. It's different.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
What'd he get you?
Mm.
You cut off your little finger?
What was your name again?
It's a mistake to think that.
Yeah?
Taking care of business.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Sooze wants to see him.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
What?
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
You don't know?
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
That, that's Indian?
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Look, your trespassing.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Look, look, just get off my property.
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
No.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
One!
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Tim!
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Nothing.
Mm-hm.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Is that a threat?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Shit, Jeff!
'Bye, Jeff.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
So how's college?
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
Well, not exactly.
What?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Well, what about this?
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
It's stupid.
It's pretty exciting.
New York, huh?
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
I'm always serious.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
You done?
I can't believe you're still here.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Nobody's fucking anybody!
Don't do that.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah.
Hey, Tim.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Oh that's nice for you.
No car.
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
Look, it's really not my fault.
You just became a statistic!
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
Well, I want to know what happened --
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
Thanks!  That'd be great.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Uh...maybe?
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Let it ride for a while.
That was the general idea.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
It will?
Saddest thing I ever heard.
It must be my new shampoo.
Twenty-two.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Whose house is it?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
Uh-huh.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Okay.
Who?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
You're a darling.
I ran into some people I knew.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
I went for a walk.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
That's right.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Frankly, no.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
You know better than to interrupt me.
Who?
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
This is the staircase of the palace.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
But which one?
Sorry, mistress.
No, a super girl.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
What do you want?
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
It's for your own protection.
Later.
You love me?
Tell me where I can find her.
What do you feel about me?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
I did.
I could force you.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Oh, sure.
How do you know?
Did anybody notice you?
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
You're not...an orphan are you?
Must've been a defective puck.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
He's nice.
Throw him out.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Better than when I was a child.
Zaltar!
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Nope.  Never. 
Brad Wilson.
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
It sure is.
Too much mayonnaise?
I didn't --
But Lana, you could --
Old ties are hard to cut.
Call me.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Oh. You're going away.
Sure.
Mmmmm . . .
What are you doing?
Yeah.
Nope, but --
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
That what they call you?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
God, that's what I keep you for.
They ain't got captains?
Fair's fair.
You designed it?
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Tell me.
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Where's the handle?
Hello.
Storms! Floods!
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
A normal person.
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Yeah. I'll check.
She'll be fine.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
What??
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Maybe you wanted to.
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
Let's go to my place.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
I'll be alright.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Now This I want to hear.
I asked the right question.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Oh! That black box in our cell?
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
What about here?
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
Something . . . wonderful.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
You're just an experiment, freako!
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
First, I have fun.
Destiny.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
One of them should've been you.
Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I know son, I know...
Not really, no.
Unbelievable.
What the  --  !
Huh?
Oh.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
You're not the only one.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
Ready.
I know...
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Lex is going bye-bye.
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
What's your name, boy?
He sure as heck does that.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Enjoyed it?
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
I guess I...uh...regressed.
On radio waves?
Alison Jones.
Which clinic?
It turns to steaming piss.
I will.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Why?
How?
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
A while.
No.  It should be dry by now.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
You believe that?
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
From what?
Berry-picking.
I did.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Why would he be frightened?
Hi, Dolores.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
Isn't it a lovely day?
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
What, Mason?
Oh.
You hate that.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
I object to that form of question. Note that.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
Daddy?
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
What is it?
Well, let's see what we get.
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
In what way?
Any criminal record?
And where did you sit that morning?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Before the actual accident?
Why were you scared?
Positive.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
How will he do that?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
There's talk of that.
But Charlene...
Alone or surrounded?
Thanks, I see him...
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
I don't believe it.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
I have a message from your sister.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
I'll listen one more minute.
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
Get Steve back his job...please...
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
You're incapable of the truth...
What about?
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
What sort of thing?
But what?
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
The renting agent and the tailor.
Take a top coat.
Why not you?
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
My mission is to protect you.
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
You told me to.
Why?
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Remember what I said, you can't...
What?
Yes.  Throw it in.
I order you not to!
Gimme that Phillips right there.
No!  Don't kill him!
Alright, it!  We need it!
I love you, John.  I always have.
Ready.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
Then what?
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
I don't know.
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
But I promised your mother.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
No. Ours was damaged.
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
What's not right?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
I don't buy that.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
No!
Tell me about von der Null.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
This is absolute nonsense!
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
How could I forget?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Never heard of him, who is he?
Sure.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
I won't let the fat kid down.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...

That's none of your business.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Freezing.
What's that?
Molecular-memory.
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
You must have had a fun child-
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
It's better that way.
You're not supposed to.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Okay.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
The stock will turn.
Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
Now, look...
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
It was an accident.
I said I was sorry...
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Don't just stand there, get help!
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Why not?
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
You first.
My hero.  Let's go.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
You?
What's wrong?
Nicholas...
Get out.
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
I'm back from the dead.
Where'd you get that gun?
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
Fuck you.
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
Shut up!
Stop it!
I have to show you...
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Okay.
Are you still on mediction?
I'll call them, okay?
I'm going to call.
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Have you gone to the police?
Yes.
Of course, Nick...
I hope.
I'll call.  I really will.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
What's all this for?
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
Don't ask.
Follow me.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
It was a misunderstanding.
You know you can.
Nothing else?
Sam...  Thank you.
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Greetings.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Yeah.
Sure.
-- how much is this car worth?
Where in the hell can she be.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
That smell... oh, God.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
I don't know.
Why?
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
No --
That?  That's Hill House.
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
Mary came with me.
Oh!  You scared me.
She was unhappy.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
Fifteen dollars.
That's why we're here.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
I know.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
I don't know, you know...
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
I don't think I want any.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
It's not a knock.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Why not?
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Lookin' good.
Huh?
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
I only asked.
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
Not me, man.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
No one else is even here yet.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
He's gotta know why.
Hard to miss.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
You look alike.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Not embarrassed.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
Why not.
Have you ever known me not to be.
What do you think.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
Just now?  Overnight?
He alive to see this?
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
What's in Big Sur?
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
And that is?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
Ian?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
I got half.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
I don't know.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
Lemme break.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
What do you think?
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
I don't want you here, Terry.
You know I don't live with him.
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Hello, Birdy.
We've certainly missed you.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Sure.
It's OK.
Uh-huh.
No, Dave, I wasn't.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Honey?
Who?
I didn't say a word.
Honey...
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
So... who... who actually--
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
Sure you don't need one?
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
So--
Yeah.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Huh?
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
...Nah.
Yeah.
Hello, Walter.
No thanks, I--
Not an owner.
They sent us to tell ya.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Uh... you're under arrest.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
I don't want to scare people.
Where's the walk-in safe?
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
What doors?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Apparently it's huge.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Got my hands full here.
All right everybody, hold up!
I'd say we're in its home.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
You're right.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
Yes.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
Eats them?
Okay.
A monster?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
Gone.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
It's scared of me.
I think... it means it's full.
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<i>Fiji.</i>
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
<i>A month.</i>
Why wouldn't I?
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Why would we--
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
A window onto the human condition?
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
I'm the creator.
You're the star.
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
I think I've studied enough.
I...I can't.
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
How about them?
This is where it started.
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
Gee, that's great.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
I made macaroni.
Good night, Mother.
Oh, my God!
I don't know--
Put some butter on it--or ice?
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You hate gambling.
There's been an accident, Truman.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
Do something...
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
Things always do--when you look back.
I'll try.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Sorry. Don't have one.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
No. Don't bother.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
I know the name. Why?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
Not according to the men in blue.
How?
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
You can't.
I've been using you?!
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Where are you, Scully?
You're looking for a bomb.
How's that?
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
I was until about an hour ago.
Get dressed, Scully.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
I can't really talk right now.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
I don't know why I think they went right.
This is great. This is fitting.
-- of what exactly?!
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
She was with me.
I'm not taking any chances.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
I have answers for you.
About the conspiracy?
I want to know where Scully is.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
What do you mean, walked?
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
A pocketful of rye...
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
No.
Yes mother.
He needs to be turned over.
What's wrong?
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
Like hell "wait."
Yep.  Eloped.
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
Delano?
Initiating connection.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Yes.
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Now?
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
They think you did it.
Sit down.
Do you understand German?
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Need we go through it all again?
In German?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Where is she?
Tell me more.
I thought you wanted...
What are you going to do?
A parrot...Let it go.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
How did you know I would be here?
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
Oh, the usual things...
Why are you lying?
Thank you.
Yes.
They're Harry's.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
No.
It wasn't important.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
I don't want it.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Just around the corner.
Best thing that ever happened...
What are you trying to say?
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
Well?...
How about the doorway?
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
You all did.
Of course.
I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
This way, miss.
No, I don't know...
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
Goodness, that's awkward.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Who?
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
I told the police.
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
You wouldn't do anything.
Why not?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
What do you want?
But you will.
The Roumanian?
Coming to the point, please.
In great pain?
English?
Yes, sir.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
You don't mean that doctor?
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Yes.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Here.
Good morning.
That's the wrong one.
One or two kilometers.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
Yes.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
You can swim?
Eh - bonsoir.
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don抰 try then we'll never know.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They don't have extermination camps.
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Yes.
I have a job.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
People still need values, beliefs....
I don't care about money.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
No.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Why?
Why not?
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Lina, come here!
I doubt it. How did you find out?
I'm stealing it.
Did you see how they reacted to him?
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Female...
He has Israel.
Listen to me....
Get the fuck away from me.
You do it on the inside....
Daniel Balint.
It's German.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Fine.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
Steve...
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Who told you that?
Number ten.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Just do it.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Wow, that's uh...great...
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
No.
Funny?
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
The documents are forged.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
No.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
No.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
What are you doing here?
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
What is it?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you very much!
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
I don't know... why?
Lucky I was there to save you.
How do you know that?
I did?
Why?
Uh... Ah!  A story?
... Not at all.
Absolutely positive.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
Anything.
No.
No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
He doesn't hear too well.
Well... here.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
You called the police?
No.  I'm just depressed.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Yes... It's magic.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
Then, goodbye.
... Yes?
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
What do you want me to do?
Please, call me Mordechai.
C'mon follow me.
Sure. Why not.
I said, do you come here often!?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Oh. Okay.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
He's still working out some identity issues.
A stereo type alarm system?
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
No, it was the perfect level.
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
It's Friday.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Good looking?
I don't know ?
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
More or less.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
No.
It's better you don't know.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
I thought they came right past here 棗
Go on foot.
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
Why?
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
Now look what you've done.
Don't be soft.
I don't know 棗 a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
Yeah.
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
And not a sign of the leopard?
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
And that is the last time any...
I抦 afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother抯 in trouble.
You... You found that at Leon抯?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
You drive a hard bargain.
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Yes... You woke me up... It抯 the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Paul Lamont...?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Have you finished?
My brother hung himself.
Leon hung himself.
Leon could still have hung himself.
Why do I feel I needn抰 answer that?
You splendid bastard...
...We抮e turning in circles.
I didn抰 know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Here we go again.
Should I?
What are you doing? You can抰. I...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
I don抰 know. Everyone抯 dead...
Can you tell me how you spell...
I抦 fine standing, thank you.
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I抎 sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There抯 a lot of people back there. They抮e holding a seminar. Trafficking抯 the past, breeding the future...
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god抯 sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
What about your friendly cop?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Huh! And they say charity抯 only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
That抯 right. Where抯 the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
She抣l be alright. She抯 tough...
May I have your phone number?
Tomorrow?
Jee... Fuck... You抮e fucking mad!
Yeah... The Diplomat.
I don抰 know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don抰 know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that抯 all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
I certainly did, sir...
La what?
Well, I hope you抮e not too heartbroken and...
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that抯 what they do to their employees, isn抰 it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people抯 lives. Thanks for the lift!
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I抎 given you and then got back, remember? I can抰 find it. Do you know where it is?
It抯 not.
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It抯 important.
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn抰 like to think I抎 kept you waiting for nothing.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Jah...
Is my money in there?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Yeah.
The lady抯 not a friend. She抯 a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
Yes...You-you抮e not going to take Shiva away?
Oh, I... She just moved. I抳e got her new... It抯 in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
... No.
... No. In fact, I抎 seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn抰 getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Good. You needn抰 worry about the Austrian anymore. He抯 dead. I抣l be in touch.
Los Angeles?
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn抰 appeal to you...
What about his girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Eh bien... T抏s s鹯 que t抋s besoin de moi?  La petite m抋 l抋ir assez bien foutue, non?
Then why don抰 you reach him?
Who?  I don抰 know who the fuck you抮e talking about, sunshine.
Fuck...
The acid bath?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn抰 go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only 慶ause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who抎 called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Shut up and walk...
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn抰 easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what抯 your business with these Spitzes?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as 揘ever Forget? Over the years we抮e talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Cost what?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Majesty, I can't...
So... pretend it's not a game.
Yes, my lord.
Do you think I could have some water?
Now?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Well...
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
But... why... what's the point?
I -- I don't understand...
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
I don't remember.  Maybe.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
Performing a miracle.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Last night.
Praying.
And may I go to Mass?
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
He's feeling wonderful.
I understand.  How much?
You think?
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
... You look wonderful...
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
That's not a lot.
For what?
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
Damn right!
Me too...
Perfectly.
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
Here -- take this instead.
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
Don't swear...
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
I said, kneel!
Playing...
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
Why not?
What do you mean, they won't come?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
So your memory's coming back?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Do you think you are ready?
No...
He never says his name.
And what does he say to you?
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
He'll be here soon.
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
What?
I haven't seen him.
It costs.
Who told you?
Yes, please.
It certainly was.
Just shut up.
They were taking you away.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
You'll be deported.
Yes, so did the Germans.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
There are always notices going up.
Toilets?
Can you help? I've no money...
Cow!
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
If you need help...
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
You made contact?
It's a little cut, nothing.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Watch your feet!
To be deaf?
... without a shred of manners.
There is something to be said for silence
Baines is packing up?
No, no bible readers.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Yes, I thought that.
Nothing just yet
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
What are they?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
She says, throw the piano overboard.
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
What will I play?
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
What's the line on Visitation?
Billie.  You ready?
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
Don't worry about it, pal.
All of it.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
They workin' for anybody?
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
Did he hold you up on anything?
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Five and call.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
But I got a train to make.
Think nothin' of it.
Sixty-five.
No.
What the hell for?
You move right along, don't ya.
I feel lucky tonight.
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
Let me talk to him.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
No.
You know how they are... sex...
Is that what it means?
It's all right.
Just a minute...
Nothing.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Now do you believe me!
And I'll give then proof!
He wouldn't say.
What do you mean?
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
tried him once -
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Yes, she would.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Not a thing.
We were looking for this bird.
What's that to you?
I'll have to try to remember.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
No.
He did!
When was that?
Did you go?
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
I said all right!
Just what I said I'd do.
So I see.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Yes?
But suppose some business comes up...
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Yes...
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
We need ice.
That's jolly.
Maybe it would if I took it.
They were kidding you.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
At breakfast.
Well, didn't you?
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Yes.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
I don't know.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
You talk as if I were Asta.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
Looks like a hold-up!
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
He was down in the shop.
Huh?
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
No, Mr. Charles.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Yes.
Y-yes.
Baghdad.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
We're going to keep driving.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
You just go when I say go.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
Maybe we should split it up now.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
We're at war.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
We thought--
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
What are you doing?
Knock it off!
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
Oh, that's fun.
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Millionaires, man.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
Mine.
Mine.  Land mine!
Just relax.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
Just stay down.
It's giving.
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
You sure you want me too?
Well, we should identify ourselves.
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
What?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
What?
The photos.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
Yeah, you're funny.
I could.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Yes!
If!  If there's a treasure.
Oh, God!
Oh, Jesus!
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
He lived through that?
You want to say some words?
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Correct.  Origin?
Violation?
Looks like dirt.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
They don't know.
We're leaving.
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
What?
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
All the insides are gone!
Where's LUH?
I'm only trying to help you.
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
Yes...
Aren't you on suspension?
You the Bomb Squad?
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Hey, look--
I don't know. You tell me?
Look, it's a longshot...
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Nothing.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Stay to your left.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
I don't know.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
No excuses, just do it!
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
A bowling alley.
We've created a monster.
Thank you.
Maybe she knows your old man.
A ticking bomb...
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
It's about this.
What?
Huh?
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Goddamit, Reilly--
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
I know.
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
No!
About tonsils.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
No.
Constantinople?
You've never been in Constantinople?
Umm.
The type they marry.
Nice suit.
I thought so.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
Yes, Baron.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
Just a second.
I hope so, too.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
I've got to see you.
What do you mean?
No, thank you.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
Lily-- 
Do you realize I have light eyes?
No. What is it? Tell me.
As you like. 
Right!
This used to be my secretary's room.
You're hired!
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
And so will M'sieu Giron.
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
You would?
Call the police?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
I don't believe it!
Giron...!
Divine ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Because I hate him--because I love you!
The pumps --
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
A hundred and one next month.
Don't drop it Rose.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
Rose Calvert.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
She knows.
You wanted to see the propellers?
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Sure. Count me in.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
No, but we're making excellent time.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
No.
You're crazy.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
She had beautiful hands.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Sure. If you like.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Jack, I --
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
To the stars.
He couldn't have.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
You think she was really there?
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
Just tell us what you can --
You had it the entire time?!
Excuse me.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Sure!
This is Miss Marsh.
I'll join you later.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Where's Lother?
Guess again, copper.
We'll be expecting you.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
Fine--I'll be glad to.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
So you washed it off!
Good-by!
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Very--your mother?
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
You can live that down, can't you?
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
How're the tips?
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
You take some awful chances.
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Sure, I'll go.
Hey!--you're tickling me.
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
I should say not.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Sure.
June? That's my wife's name.
O.K.! Send that!
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Knots!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
So what?
Well, did you find me?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Who won?
I was never stiffer in my life.
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Are you happy?
Like it?
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
Do what--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Somebody's got to do it--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
What's he got that I haven't got?
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Telegrams.
Hey--you! Where you going?
Isn't that a daisy?
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Maybe even my destiny.
Come and get him.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
This brand.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I was kidding about that.
Enough?  Never.
But who was the Devil?
I'll remember you said that.
No...
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
Then what do I do?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Sorry...
What?  But I saw 'em-
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
Colorado's closer
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
I laugh sometimes
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
That didn't sound like thunder.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
You're on.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Jack...
They're carrying guns in town.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Wyatt...
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
I can feel your pain.
Sightseeing.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
I see...
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Hey - the world is my office.
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Three. You? Married?
Thanks.  Take care -
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
- You're not.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
What?
My father left me the business.
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Up.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
If not?
Yes, M.
I understand.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Stop it!
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
I am. What do you want?
Captain Morton.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
I see you two have met.
...I see.
My timing always was lousy.
Get more men up there!
Yes. Shall we kill them?
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
You always got something to say.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
Maybe I can get down there next week.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Like muddy waters?
Babe Brother.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
It would be nice.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
Everything these days is made overseas.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Good afternoon to you.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Now who are we talking about?
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
What's a toby?
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Where was the last place you left him?
What?  What is it?
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Mm-hmmmmm.
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
You can't!
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Trouble?!  Where?!
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Don't tell me what to do!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Look out!!
Woody!  The rocket!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Not today!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Heh-heh.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Have you been replaced?
You murdering dog!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
I was close to being scared that time.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
He got it, Woody!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Sid!!!
That's right.  Your toys.
No, Slink --
Got it.
But you're Irish!
I did like the music.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
She got away.
Home is where the heart is.
She'll have to learn.
You're not so old yourself!
Let me in.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
Did you now.
Juliet who?
You're late for breakfast.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
I don't know what you mean.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Arnie, this is crazy.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Carl --
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
Me, too.
I don't know.
Not yet.
What do you think?
Will we get invited to the White House?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Yeah.
I get A's.  All A's.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Then here's a little bump.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
So does half of San Diego.
No --
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
When will you do it?
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
I feel like a traitor.
An informant.
It was an anonymous tip.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
Any idea how much?
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
You won't say anything to my parents?
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Like you protected Landry?
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
No. On you go.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
You've stabbed me, man.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Can you not go yourself.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Certainly not.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
It's Iggy Pop.
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
Fuck, OK.
Oh, really?
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
No.
No.
Cheers.
Nightmare.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
What do you mean?
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
Give me the gun.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Your usual table, sir?
Are you serious?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Went ballistic?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Rescued at last.
Plotting our new course.
Raise shields.
A Federation starship.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Oh, please.
What do you know of my pain?
The power was within you.
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I don't understand.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Yes, Spock?
Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Yes, Captain.
Captain, what have I done -
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
I have a half brother.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
The emergency channel, open.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
I'm afraid of nothing.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Am I? We'll see.
No conditions.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...

Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
He's not?
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
Do you?
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
You call that getting over it?
That Dillinger's on to him.
For being on to Dillinger.
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
I'm certainly not.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
For sure...
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Not a chance.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
The Pentagon?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
You wouldn't dare.
It can be arranged...
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Where did you hear that name?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
Tron...?
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
Alan-One...
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
Do it!
Then I owe you some thanks...
It's something Users do.
I'm shocked.
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Simon?  Ohmygod.
Where are you going?
Yeah, Dad.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Yes.
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
What?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Here, check these out.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
Son of a bitch!
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Here they come.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
I wasn't cheating!
I agree.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Oral hygiene?
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
Yeah, it was wild.
I'll handle it.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
No.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Yes.
Do you still love your husband?
Yes or no.
Sure, hon.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
What about Juno?
Did you pork her Harry?
God, you have great legs.
No.  Much more.
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Fuck you.
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Yes.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
Yes.  Now go.
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
I don't know.  I have to think...
His wife.
What letter?
He wants to speak with you.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
And here we are.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
The oriental.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
What time is it?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
How 'bout me what?
What do you want to know?
What's your favorite movie star?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Almost four years.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
At the movies?
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
I just gotta get somethin'.
Why?
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
How come?
Cancoon.
Heard that.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
I don't blame you.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
I'm her husband.
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Now tell him goodbye.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
It'll get ya high.
Tell me.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Let me handle this.
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
What department?
They'll be along.
I guess so. Follow me.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
We grew up together.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
She seems very nice.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Do tell. Why drug related?
No shit?
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Uh-huh.
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
I believe he believes him.
Or a supporting actor -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
Rock whores.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
What can I do?
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
Yeah, I live here.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
What's she doing?
And your only goal is...???
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
You wouldn't understand.
I have to go.
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
I've got one now.
Jeffrey Mason?
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
Give me the gun.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
I...I...We need cash, James.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
I need to make a telephone call.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
You really want to know?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, yeah.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Out of here.
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
You son of a bitch!
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
It is morning.
Kirin?
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
I think I burned my gun hand!
I . . .
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
Who the hell is this!?
You sure you can manage?
No trouble at all, really.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
I guess it must.
Come here.
What?
Games?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
You know what I want.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Whatever it takes.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Yeah.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
What was I supposed to do?
We're going all the way.  Together.
No.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
You killed him!
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Now what?
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Grace!
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
A lot that means.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Just ran into a little trouble.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
How do you put a price on murder?
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
All I have in the world.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
That's a thick change of heart.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Not before I settle with you.
Stand up.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
What for?
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
And you're taking?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
But, Senor--
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
Stand up.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Live there?
About what you said this morning.
You love her, but you hate her?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
How do you want it?
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
No!
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
What are you talking about!
What?
Cause she's dead.
Oz.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
Will you shut up!
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Yeah, I can fix it.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
How much!?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
What?
Darrell.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Do you have to call me that?
It's Grace.
You're welcome, Grace.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Did you like it; me watching you?
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
You could leave him.
Yeah.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
Can you make it back up?
Harlin's.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
Which you don't have.
But, in particular?
One way.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
What was that all about?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
I said come on!
Wow.
Four.
Oh.
Yes. Is this David?
Jesus.
Rust?
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
Think carefully?
Seventy-five percent.
Skeptical about what?
We've already begun.
Is there a problem?
You thought he was carrying a knife?
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
That's not what I witnessed David.
We are.
Yes he is.
What's he look like?
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
I won't make any noise.
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
Two hundred and seventy.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Okay.
Against a window.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
Innocent of what?
We was... lyin'.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Advances?
You want... a free one.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
He admit it?
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
What's your name?
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
Lookin' at?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
You still think he's in there?
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yeah.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
Yeah.
Eleven.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
You ain't like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Beats the hell out of me.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
You're marking us, Bill.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Two.
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
Plenty of times.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
And ?
I'm having a stroke.
Goddamnit.
They'll never stop.
They ruined me tonight.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Umm ...
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
County. I was in for fraud.
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
You okay?
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
Just do what I tell you.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
We'll see.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Business or personal?
You didn't know.
Someplace else, then.
Kobayashi.
No.
Kobayashi.
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
Wait a minute.
Then why didn't you help him?
I don't
Because he was my friend.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
I'm fine.
Very good.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
You thought it was just.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
Gruber...
It looks that way.
Just as you are, Sir...
I'm just an M.D.
Through, through his book.
I am seventy-four years old.
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Huh!
You may step down.
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
I . . ..
You've just said you signed it.
I thought I would need it.
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
Hold on a second.
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
Well...
The Doctors were not negligent.
No, you did fine.
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
No.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Mr. Concannon...?
Mr. Alito, please.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Still looking.
The TV didn't work.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Laura.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
You're talking like a drunk.
And what makes you so tough?
Is there going to be a later...?
It's over!
No.
I have to talk to you.
What do you want?
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
What?
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Oh shit, what's today?
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
The broad has disappeared...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I don't know.
I don't want a mistrial.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Thanks, Franky.
Yes, that's correct.
We, we were rather busy...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Huh.  And why is that?
How'm I doing so far?
Yes.
I married into it.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
No, I'm all right.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
It's not my line.
But you knew about this.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
You won't have to.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Dinner... and what else?
Because I remind you of her?
Okay.
No.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Judy --
Yes.
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Is that the best you can do?
Too late. I've got my face on.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Oh, yeah. There.
Take me away...
Why?
Where had you been before?
This afternoon.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
My name is John Ferguson.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
Wander about.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
The tall trees...
Long ago...
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
Yesterday.
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
I know.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
All the time.
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
And it's a all real.
You can't.
Why?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Ah, Johnny-O...
Okay.
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Yeah.
Do you know him well?
For what?
I'll take you home.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Where?
Oh?
Did you need it?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
What is it, a still life?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Can we have it by tonight?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
What?
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
It's sacrilegious.
I'm not getting a ticket.
You want to hear me out?
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
Just giving the facts.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
I don't give a damn.
What?
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
I know...
What.
I got you.
Don't sweet lip me.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sweet deal.
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Not tonight.
I'm not talking to you?
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
Nobody knows.
I'm calling the police.
You always were a jealous man.
Say it again.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Hear what?
Isn't it a little late?
You're sick.
Oh really? Starbucks?
True.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
We're not goosed.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
How about my Fatburger?
What?
I do.
I don't think so.
I think so.
Sent it.
I think I forgot the tent.
What?
Right before the wedding?
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
It's vile!
Of course.
Okay.
I'm not. What's the problem?
What kind of seats can we have?
I'll call them from the road.
I will.
Nesting?
I'm mad at you.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Are they fighting?
We're not canceling.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
But...
What money?
You did all right dad.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
I don't hear it.
The wahoo moment?
What is it?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Downstairs in the closet.
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
Oh I know that. How does it go...
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
You'd like me to kill them?
Two.
What's that?
You'll think you're still at the convent.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
How could anybody behave like that?
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
You must listen to me before you go.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
Fifteen yards.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Nothing.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
Why?
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
Leave him alone.
I'll be ready.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
From the terrace.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device 棗 it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
I don't know.
Then I guess we're even.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re梐ssignment.
Only because I got pulled out early.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
It was me, what?
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
You like baseball?
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
I couldn't tell you.
Duck!
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
My...secret.
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
I've got some final preparations to take care of棗 Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand...

It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Why?

The War is Over.
Fine. 
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
Quite touching.
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...

Who're you working for?
I have a question for you.
Why do people go to war?
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?

"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
They got him standing by.
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?

<u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
...what is this?
The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.
See y'at the Finish Line.
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
It's a <u>beret</u>...
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
I'm just talking about the Hats.

What about tipping off Yurovich?
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Please, no thanks... 
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Then get out and close it behind you.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
Start unloading.
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
What are you doing here?
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Oh no, no...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Jackson, Steinem...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
Yes...
I don't understand.
Allright. Wait here...
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
What makes you think you can?
How much is enough Gordon?
Obviously...
Excuse me.
Oh yes, I remember you.
And what do you want?
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
It's eleven forty-five let's go
Suffer?  We're living in America.
Ok toots, I will.
A party at a waxwork huh?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Vell.  Goodnight.
That's not what you said last night.
China
Go away.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Hey.
No, he wouldn't.
A ghost?
Then why did you?
You're joking.
Mm-hmm.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
At the party.
I'm not...
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
You do?
Um...sure.
Claire.
Stop.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
I don't know.
Please.
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
Relieved?
All of us.
What are you going to do?
If she was dangerous before--
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Don't.
It's Saturday.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Fine.
You are...
I know.
Mmm.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
In the house.  I was scared.
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Well, that's a relief.
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
You told me that I was...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
What's the matter?
What?
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
It's alright.
What?
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Come.  There is a lot to read
A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
The lamplight.  That's all.
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
He just went out like & light-
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
Always loved you..
Explain this to me --- violated...?
Go away!  I don't want you here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I LOVE him!
I love Michael...
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
The one time I want it to work...
Rowan...
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
And whose houses do you design...?
You still feel that crazy...?
He fools around with his patients too.
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Captain's orders.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Mad. for each other.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
Mm-hmm...
Talking to me dear...?
Lock the door.  Lock it
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
What were you talking about...?
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Papers...?
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
I think I will pass...
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
I don't want to talk about it -
I don't know...
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Then make it stop...
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Open it...
Out - I may be some time
Yes - I suppose so...
What was I supposed to do?
At 2.00...
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
Yes I can...
Don't worry about it -
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Yes - one please.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Astronomical.
Cut it out, before you break something!
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
These are real, live women?
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Yeah?
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
But that smile.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
Do it?
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
Well, why should I?
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
Some of them have to be automatics.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Of course we were.
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
You mean they knew who I was?
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Very funny.
You want it in writing?
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
I have absolutely no intention--
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
You never know around here.
Is this an gritty expos?or a candy ass press release?
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
It's incredibly simple.
But you never do.
I'm very aural.
You're quick. I like that.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
Yellow pages?
You better.
Only the best for my mother.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Rules are rules.
Tipping?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
You think we should be more open minded?
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
It's about your parents.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Eat a power bar.
Thanks.
And where might that be?
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
He was large?
Suzie Toller is missing.
You could tell me where you were last night.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
You have someplace to be?
Ray, you heard him...
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
I said he did.
Lombardo ever come out here?
Curiosity, I guess.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
Whichever one I want.
About six and a half million dollars.
Do it to ourselves?
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
That's not your line.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
You think that's wise?
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
What's that supposed to mean?
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
That's cop bullshit.
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
The one you bought at school.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Jim West.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Almost?
All what?
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
I'm going to hit you.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
It's better than nothing.
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
Relax.  We're almost there.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Thank you.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
Where have you been?
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
Really?
I don't like to lose, either.
You tell me.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Private train?
No, sir... just a businessman.
Dr. Loveless?
Who was this partner of his?
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
They're coming.
You're not going to use it, are you?
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
You managed alright.
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
No.  I mean yes.
Why not?
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Madmartigan.
I have no family.
As above, so below.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Why.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
I hate this.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
I will.
Of course!  I promise!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Elora Danan!
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
No!
What do I need for that?
Why?
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Surrender!!
I changed her already!
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
The sorceress.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
I thought I was the English.
Try the house.
Pick up the hat.
Who'd you see?
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Yeah.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight ?street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
Maybe.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Just us.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
What?
But you can't.
Anything against zippers?
I'm going this morning.
I know what he said.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
Johnny, what the fuck?
I hear you.
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch ?I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
He's got my number.
I don't know where he is.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
You are acting like one!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I don't think she knows.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
You'll be hist...
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
You are?
I don't believe you!
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
This?
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Toto, too.
Whenever you wish.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
My mouth -- my mouth!
Oh...
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh.
The nerve.
Yes.
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
Not nobody, not nohow!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
But why?  Why?
Oh, come on.
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Ohhh --
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Where's Kansas?
To Oz?
What?
Here -- here --
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
What was that?
Fine.  He's got a plan
Yeah. Me?
It's a whatzis?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Not nohow!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
Hurry -- hurry --
Oh --
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Well, I --
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Then it抯 no longer a bomb?
Elektra King.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He抯 not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub抯 reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Elektra would control it all.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
慣hat which does not kill me makes me stronger.?
The worm on the hook again.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
No.
You抮e not going to.
...you should rest.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Have some of the rat抯 nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
Where did you get this?
What抯 your business with Elektra King?
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Your father...
Someone will come.
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Yes.  Au revoir...
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
It抯 heading for the oil terminal.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
Washington?
Don't call me that.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Veidt箂 complex.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Antarctica??
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
I don't know their real names.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Ever see one of these before?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Looks like a diner.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
Naturally.
"Anarchy" 99"?
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Go to hell.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
I'm from L.A.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
When can I see you again?
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
That's would be me.
That one I'm real familiar with.
I thought that was in detail.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Is this what you're looking for?
When else are you gonna do it?
Of course.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
We all do.
Beast.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
For what purpose?
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
It's too far.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
He takes his work seriously.
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
Senator?
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
How?
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
The way what is going to be?
What do you mean to do?
I know.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
From your office, sir.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
MMmmm.
Yes.
Whatever makes you happy.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
Surprised!
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
A week.  Ten days at most.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
How old are you, young man?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I wonder what's got into them?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
What?
Could be worse!
I have a pretty good idea.
This guy means business.
What?
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
You can say that again.
... I'm glad that's...
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
How do you know it was a 'she'?
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
Is everything ready?
It's alive!
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
How nice.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
What a filthy mess.
Well, this explains the music.
And look at this, Doctor!
I thought it was wonderful.
I think I'll...carry him.
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
I know Frederick.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
And I have mine.
MMmmm.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Food!
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
But will they make good use of them?
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?

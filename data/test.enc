No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Well, no...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Did you change your hair?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Where've you been?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
In 9th.  For a month
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
But
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Daddy, I --
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
No, but
How many people were in your old school?
Why not?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
You got him involved?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
You hate me don't you?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
hey.  Great show, huh?
Okay?
You don't care if I die
I thought you were above all that
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Wholesome.
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
A soft side? Who knew?
State trooper?
That ' s completely adorable!
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I know.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Why can't we agree on this?
Kat a fan, too?
Say it
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What?!
Ever been to Club Skunk?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
You're completely demented.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Have a great time, honey!
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
You can see for yourself.
May I ask by whom?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
What does he say?
No...
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
Chief knows.
... and also to bring medicine.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
God... That's in a week!
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
How can you be so certain?
I am listening, my son.
I have to disagree.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
You must be mad...!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
...delusions and paranoia.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
But it's...
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
I can't take you to my place.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
I don't even watch TV.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
Mind if I ride along with you?
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
You thirsty?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
How many victims are up there?
Hey, honey.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
And what do you do with the bones?
Are you married?
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Where's your partner?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
We are both from Prague.
Who is he?
This all you want?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Turn that fucking thing off!
What is it?
What is that?
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Yes, the money is good.
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
New York.
A cheap hotel.
Well, he killed my partner!
How did you start the fire this time?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
What?
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
CONTINUED
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
I guess not.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
CONINUED
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Fortunately, they did.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
Yeah?
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
What's the matter with my place?
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
You got a name, cop?
Yeah?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
I don't give out the details.
Hey, you wanna bet?
There.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
They saved your ass, convict.
He's after your money.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
No class...
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Which one pulled the trigger?
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Doesn't look like it.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
What am I wanted for?
Call me later.
Great place for lunch.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
You real down?
Surprise, Luther.
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
It's a miracle!!!
What's she doing?
They really made her...
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Do you love her?
At least, the cat comes back.
I just found a picture of you.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
...Priest...
When EVIL returns so shall we.
...Hello?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
6... 5...
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
Six to the left. One to the right.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
What did you say? What did you do?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
It's my wife.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Apipoulai!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
You noticed..
...Like love...
At least I won lunch.
It's not?
This thing solid?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
I want your best man on this!
They just landed in the desert.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Drink!
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Am I disturbing you?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
How's the detective business?
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
What happened to you?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You couldn't?
Snuff?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What do you want?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
What the fuck... !
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Where's that?
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
You're a dead man.
... sorry...
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Look, you cocksucker...
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
You almost went over your limit.
Big date tonight?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Truman Capote.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
What about me?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
You're learning.
Alright, I get the picture.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Who is he?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
What's this?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
He's odd.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
You don't have any other choice.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
I'm not positive this means anything.
How are you?  Having any luck?
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
Yes... ?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
Do you know what happened to her?
What is this?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Alice, you think you can leave?
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I've been working double shifts.
How long have you been awake?
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
Rick, please.
Nice neighborhood.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Been up with Alice.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Mommy...?
There you go.  Love you.
Dad!
Thanks for everything, Dad.
Very funny.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
You think that's the place she's buried?
Then get out!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
Where are you going?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
How is he - ?
You could train someone else.
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
I think you're right.
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Dave - !
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Is there any way out of it?
Excuse me, Skipper---
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Now they feel it...down below.
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
What do you think?
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
No.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Chub says you're fired.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
You see it?
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
He's on to us!
If you get it?
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
I'm okay.
I used to play ball.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Like you and Gordon?
Bastard's got his high beams on.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Where'd you get the blood?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Saw him do it?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Yeah.
It's fun.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
What do you want, then?
Huh?
Don't go playing policeman.
You don't want the extra police pay?
What's the hurry?
Something bugging you?
What do I have to do for it?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Want to buy?
The key, Wade.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
We should talk.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You okay?
I'm sorry.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Call me.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Oh, Wade.
You've been married twice --
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
This is nuts.
It makes me sad.
Hold on!
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Something about my father?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Marg!
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Rolfe.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
What about Margie?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
I don't know. You tell me.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Got it.
How we doing, Colonel?
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
The rest of the secret service?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Leave my daughter alone.
What do you know of my husband?
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
I'll not going without my family.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
How did your speech go?
Did they say anything about my family?
What's going on?
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
What's the story?
What is it, Mary?
Shut down accelerators.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
What are you doing, Ted?
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Ted, the lever!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Have you got it straightened out now?
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
Do you want to talk about it.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Can't you take a guess?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
Elaine!
What's the matter?
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
But Ted, you're the only...
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
See them, Elaine?
Airsick?
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Roger.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
William Harcourt?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Well... yes, quite possibly.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Screw you.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
Where'd you get this?!!
She's going to divorce me.
Well, let's roll, George.
What was that about?
How potent?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...

Shit!
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
What is this?!
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Movement!
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Amy.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
I get the picture.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What's he scanning for?
I told them to fall back...
What's the question?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Let's go!  Let's go!
What's this?
It's game time.
Locked.
Ellen.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
It's inside the complex.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
Nine meters.  Eight.
So what do I tell this guy?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Yes.  A little girl.
Don't go!  Please.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
What's that?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
What did you think of the music?
Oh - excuse me!
No, she's fine.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
You have leave to try.
Why what, sir?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Now?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
That's stupid.
Do you think that's funny?
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
What's the matter with you?
What?
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
No. Don't answer it!
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
It is miraculous.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
This is not his handwriting.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Behold!
I said play!
What a strange young man.
Really?
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
What a charming idea. May I see?
My pleasure.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Do you like this, Salieri?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Yes, where?
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Pupils?
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Are you playing a trick on me?
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Where?
Sssh!
What did he say? What did he say?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
What for?
Love, Sire!
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Do you have a daughter?
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
I can't say. Really
How fortunate.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
But what is it they don't like?
You flatter me.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Where did I stop?
Do you believe in it?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
And that's all?
And that's it. Do you have it?
Oh? Have I seen it?
Exactly. A dance.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Well?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
What?
Yes.
No, you didn't!
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Well, promise then.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Herr Salieri.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
How did he look?
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Yes.
What shall we do?
Could you get here without any trouble?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Call me David.
You're a very beautiful girl.
That's easy enough.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Anything.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
David, what are you doing?
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
No what?
How are we feeling tonight?
He all right?
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Who is this girl?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Some, everyone does.
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
You're in a hospital in London.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Jack.
You're not having a good time are you?
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Okay.
Nice looking group.
Could be a lot of things.
Shit! David, what is that?
Come on, where?
It's moving.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
See anything?
Where are we going?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
What?!
It's you, David.
What are you doing here?
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
Hi, Jack.
What can I say, Jack?
You look awful.
No, thank you, Doctor.
What can we do to assist you?
What's that?
Sorry.
Oscar, what's the matter?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Let me have ten bucks?
Charlie!
And tell him not to delay.
What good will that do?
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything?
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Say, you can't do that?
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
know, but?
梤unning around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
Well, what?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Shall we let the people come in?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
The theatre?
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Yes?
Mr. Dickson?
You haven't got a uniform?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Why pick on him ?
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
In Cluett's office?
Oh now, don't be silly.
They must have turned him down.
Did you talk to him?
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
How are you fixed?
Everybody in?
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
We got a problem here, brother?
How'd they --
Bob. I didn't...
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Beg pardon?
He's planning a job.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
I got seven thousand.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Still smells fishy.
Missed you, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Where'd you get all these riders?
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
Frank, don't you have something to say?
You are a charmer.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
This has been a good year.
You've killed your fair share of men.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
We're doing this for Ma.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
That he was.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
You shouldn't be up.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
I don't understand.
I beg your pardon?
You almost ended my career before it began.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Really?
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
What is that?
That.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
What the hell is that sound?
On a lot of lithium?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Uh huh.
Dorsia's nice.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Why?
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
What are you doing tonight?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
I haven't seen you around here.
Really?
He's good-looking.
We need to talk.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
But what about the past? Our past?
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Are you my two o'clock?
Can I help you?
Are you sure?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Carnes? Wait.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
That's Paul Owen.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
SHUT UP!
What's that, a gram?
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Dorsia, yes?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
After six.
Oh? And what should I say?
Oh, something. . romantic?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Yes, Patrick?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Well...
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Yeah.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Oh no, I'm okay.
How old are you?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Don't you know this?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Actually, yes.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
He does? You're sure?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Is that a raincoat?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
What!
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
I can't just walk away!
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
...wanna savor this.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Milo?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
You're interfaced with our dish.
What?!
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
...Hello?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
You've been coming in early.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
Gary, I --
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
Okay, #2.
Ready for number three?
Gary?
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Lisa.
You know mine.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
He's out of prison?
Do we post it on the Net?
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
How close are you?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Meet me at the other location.
Latitude 47 degrees.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
What is it?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
When do I begin?
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Oh, and Austin...
Oh, and Austin...
Thank you, Basil.
Yes?
Carnies.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Do I make you horny?
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Why did you leave so soon?
A limousine has just pulled up.
I don't get it.
Why?
Oh, yes you are.
Who?
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Noooooooooooooo!
Shut up.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
You didn't...
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
What do you want to do, Scott?
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
Nature ...
Hope...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Then you can't come in.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Quite a collection.
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
An unholy trinity ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
The result would be ...
Doctor Peel, I presume?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
I didn't. Mother did.
My father always wanted a boy.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
That's what we were working on.
Do you always drive this fast?
This must be the last straw.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Mmm ... what are you doing?
I'm playing to win.
No, after you.
What's that you're wearing?
What is it?
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
You're better than I expected.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
You said ... one shot.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
Does Cole know about this?
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
What?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Hello?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole, we've got to talk.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Let's go.
Why is Cole here?
A strange wang right in my palm.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Great bathing suit.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
That's it, prick lips.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
You okay?
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
I'd love that.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Ed... you're kinky!
You've been having strange sex...!
Where the hell is he?
What's the matter?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Who was that?
What's this?
Hey, you guys...
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Did you do it for Tim?
-- He killed people --
Sheep don't count.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
Roll the hose.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
...Not now, Brian.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Hey.
I could use a date.
You think that's really any of your business?
Okay.
What is --
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
I need another one, sir.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
Nice bunch of guys.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Then who wrote the report?
Did I say thanks?
Your brother was a good man.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Four months?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Aren't you even curious?
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
Firehouse.
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He treats you okay?
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Knock it off. Now.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
You don't know... nobody knows...
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
People.
Yeah.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Do you have the money?
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
I'm not smiling.
Seconds and thirds, too.
Please, have a seat.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
You're in this up till ya neck.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
I won't do it anymore.
But the line has to be drawn.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Word!!!
I'm feelin' dis'!
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
So what's up with you?
You lost me.
What point is that?
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
You okay?
What is your problem?
Your life will never be the same.
Same here.
Thanks.
How so?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Don't make me have to use this.
Hi, Mona.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
No.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
How did you get this gig?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
No, not that.  How 'bout...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
...not that time...
Around...
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
So what's up with you?
The good stuff.
Oh you do, huh?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
You don't read, do you?
What?
And?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
I know I won't be your puppet.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
I don't know.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
I have no luggage.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
I believe they will deport you.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
How so?
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
All the same, you must name an amount.
Does this assignment interest you?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
You framed-him...
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
What business?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
Cadet, what's your name!
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
So you killed him?
Roberto, what the fuck?
Right?
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Something funny, Levi?
How do you know?
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
He's in interrogation?
Move him.
Baseball?
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
That was kid gloves?
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
I pushed him too hard.
So what now?
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
I don't think I want to hear this --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
No one else heard it?
Dunbar says you were.
It won't work --
Who, Levi --
What happened with Nunez?
Thank God...
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
Then do it.
Fine, you do it.
You get the eye?
Will.
Can I see him?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Yeah.
You must be Edward Bloom.
In so many words, yes.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
I'll...
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
Karl.
You're not trying to run away?
Jesus Christ.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
She was a witch.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
You know where the chemicals are?
Why not religion, Dad?
Did I ever tell you about how...
Son?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Where are we headed?
How can I convince you to stop?
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I don't believe it!
Are you Jenny Hill?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
You didn't become crazy.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'm going to check on him.
You need to go.
I talked with your father last night.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Do you love your father?
I need you on my side.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
How is he?
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
So you never bought any land.
What?
Yes. I know.
Hold on.
She says she has a secret to tell.
I...
What was that?
Tell me what he said.
What did he say? Tell me!
Oh Jesus.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Today is bath day.
Syevodnya?
They go. John. They go.
So what are you going to do?
In every sense. If at all possible.
Fine.
Oh Jesus.
I don't want to talk about it.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
We'll pretend it never happened.
I don't hate you.
And? What are you saying?
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
I got what I paid for.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
I don't have nothing.
I'm sorry.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Nobody's that unhappy.
I don't want anyone to die.
You know you can come under the blanket.
Goodbye.
Why?
It's a long way to go for a date.
What does it mean?
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
My name's Sophia.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
I bet you have loyal customers.
When? Now? Oh. No.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Hi.
For your hands?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
YOU SHUT UP!
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Gal, you ain't right yet.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
LET ME GO!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
You take it straight?
Where you gonna be?
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
I don't want you to let go.
You need some weed?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Why's his britches round his knees?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
I skipped lunch.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Hey.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
What?
I'm a what?
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
What happened to your face?
You got any money?
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Back-up.
Why?
Some party.
Nick... You up?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Let's go.
Getting very weird.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
You cool, Ich?
All right, how's the new partner?
You'll take care of that.
Where're you going, Ichiro?
Nick!
She disappeared... shit!
You can't come in.  They don't want --
Where does this Sugai live?
It's illegal, Nick.
Joyce?
I'm sorry.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
Where's the wife?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
We're in?
Keep the change.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
She's such a long way home for you.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
I want a gun.
We're police officers.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
Why tell me this?
Good.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
And what can he do for you?
What's the problem?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Why are you staring at us?
We have a lot in common.
No.
I think, therefore I am.
I want to do it.
You got a machine on it yet?
Yeah.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
You equipped for random questions?
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Next.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Vodka!
Prosit.
How old am I?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Money?
What's that?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
You're going to be over the limit.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
It's a good job.
Jeezus!
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
I told you I'd come back.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Bad?
May I ask a personal question?
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
How many questions did it take?
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
What?
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
My office.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
It was amazing.
Do you own a car?
Nope.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Watching television in color.
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Who are these people?
Very funny, smart ass.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Yes.
It does?
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
Where's he gone?
The what?
About clothing?
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
No it's not!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
What?
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
Eve?!
I know first aid!
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
My pleasure.
Hi, Eve!
A card?
Are you all right?
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
What's baseball?
Like a painting?
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Well, do we just go on up?!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
You're sure?
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
I love Lucy!
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Right on the button.
That's right?
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
That would knock my father out.
What?!
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
What?
And thanks for always being happy!
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
I'm afraid you've got to.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Right.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
This is your bedroom?
No.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
He drank it hot?
Good god.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Well, put it down and come in!
You hear that?!
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Home sweet home!
Oh, no.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Calvin?!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Let's eat our cake.
In the generator room again?
Yes, yes it is!
I want him to at least see the sky!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
How long will you set it for this time?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
I don't know.
You're serious, aren't you?
That water's freezing!
Um... Eve?
Go to the bathroom.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
What?!!
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
I don't think so.
To get some frozen poultry.
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Are you Detective Williams?
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Is Sandy part of this?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Sure I'm alright. 
No.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Don't say that.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
I liked being with you last night.
Look.
Yes. Frank--
Are you a bad boy?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
You called me Jeffrey.
Yes.
I guess I should go.
What?
Hello, daddy.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
What time are visiting hours?
What?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
No, you're right.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Oh yeah?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, how are you going to do that?
So, what's next?
Brilliant.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Yeah, but.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Everything okay?
You want to dance?
Really?
Probably not. No. Why?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
What did he bring him in for?
I need Il Duce.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Lord's name.
Look under the body.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Anybody see ya?
What the fuck are you doing?
What? What is it?
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
Hello.
Yeah, we promise.
What are you going to do?
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Who did you kill?
Give the guy a shot.
He isn't to be touched.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
And number three, Dolly.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
The what man?
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
Who the...
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
What the...?
Oh my god!
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Fuck you!
Roc. You okay?
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Yes.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
What color hair does he have?
Making Hutch David Soul?
OK. That's wrong.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
Why?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Where are you going?
Did you see that?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Holy shit.
What about what that guy said?
Yeah.
Well, then cut it in half.
See if mine are in there.
What about them?
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
May I have a word with you, please?
What the fuck is going on here?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
They don't?
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
He went back for his brother.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I have an idea for that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
Our money situation is not good.
Sixteen dollars.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
That's what she is!
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
Dignan. Take it easy.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Who tripped the alarm?
What?
You're living on a sailboat?
How big is it?
What's he in for?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
You mean a safecracker?
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Did Dignan take the test?
Are you afraid?
Exactly. Woah.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Jesus, Bob.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Were you born in Mexico?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
That's Anthony.
Wait. Did he see us?
Are you a fag?
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
No.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
Bob.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
What are you doing?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
Bob. Are you coming?
The weed.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
How long has he been in there?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
What do you mean get back?
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Not in that car you're not.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
Bob, you're lying!
Come on!
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
I couldn't hear anything.
Applejack drove.
How's that 700 bucks coming?
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
I might have mentioned it.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
The grammar?
Join the party, fellas.
Why?
Where did he go?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
Excuse me.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Sit down.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
That's not what happened to your parents.
-- what? --
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
Sleep. Sleep now.
But we were so careful.
But you're sure?
Where --
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
Switch! You drive!
I wanted to kill him.
See that tram coming around the corner?
A Russian?
And you got to him before we could.
Abbott?
My first job.
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Oh, shit...
Why am I alive?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
You didn't answer my question.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
How long have you worked for the agency?
Good luck.
Are you an expert in amnesia?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Anything?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
Someone dead from this household?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Stephen ready?
Rest, William.
They're coming!
Three, maybe more!
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Thank you for accepting.
I want... to marry you!
I'm not just saying it!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
Tonight then.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Anything.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
We're gonna be late again.
No.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Just. Like. Jason.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Oh God... what did we do?
Ouch.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
I just thought you should know.
There's one major hole in your story.
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
And you are...?
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
Meant no offense.
Monsieur Rick?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Yes, of course, we --
I don't know the finish yet.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
I don't understand. What about you?
Hello, Sam.
It's been a long time.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Where is Rick?
You are very kind.
I must find out what Berger knows.
Goodnight.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Our faithful friend is still there.
Did he give any reason?
Ilsa, I --
-- Is what?
Good evening.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
No, Captain, please.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
And that is?
Even in Berlin.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
You're late.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Make it official, if you like.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Hello?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Boss, let's get out of here.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
What's that you're playing?
Do too little you'll die.
No.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
You know what happened to this?
No.  that was the last one.
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
Hey, look at you.
I can't even keep fish alive.
I have to.
No.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
Her name's Hannah.
What's that, written on the sail?
You okay?
I love you, Chuck.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
I am one lucky guy.
Yes, yes he did.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
How'd it go?
I was making a point.
Forget it.
You are one sick fucker.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
Hello?
You're fucking dead!
Hello.
How about we go somewhere else?
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
Digital laser readers.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
He'll need clothes... some money...
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
So, Mrs...
Oh...
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
I better go.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
There! You said it was boring.
I thought they might take me.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
That's true.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
Is *your* father dead?
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Liberator...
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
Where are you going?
It's almost like flying.
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
What business is you in, Homer?
What's that? What's it called?
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
You're not yet three months, are you?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
They told me I was too old to serve.
*What* view?
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
We had to finalize the deal.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Nice.
You're a superstitious fucker.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
We were back on.
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
How much we going after?
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
So that's it...
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Excuse me?
Come on. Harder.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
What the hell's his problem?
You need to get a haircut.
And some new clothes.
Uh... Everything okay?
How do you know I will?
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
Jesus... Take it easy.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
What about...
Meet me at my place later.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
Is it all fugasi?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
What'd he say?
What happened?
Sorry. What?
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
Just a tip.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Peace of mind.
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
You trust this Moonan guy?
It's just insurance.
I got scared.
What?!
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
She went back to South Africa.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
I don't gamble.
How's that football story corning along?
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
It came my way. 450 a week.
Are you trying to read my palm?
You're my conscience.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
That girl, she works at the casino --
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Why did you take the money?
No.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
Oh hello.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
Do you believe in astrology?
He doesn't gamble.
What happened?
I know that. But you can now.
They mean it.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
You've been avoiding me.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Does Bella come here?
Don't worry, I won't report you!
Where did you go to school?
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
I make it six.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
Thanks for the information.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
The key!
Where's the fail-safe key?
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Snap out of it, bomb.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
That's it.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Veil nebula.
-- open circuit breakers --
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Negative effect.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Sir?
Who are you?
No wire.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Move it.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
But I'm afraid of--
Where'd you clip this?
Same old story.  Not interested.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
You didn't...
Damn... Are you alright?
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
No...
Sophy?  Are you okay?
I was expecting someone else.
How'd you find me?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
Bent.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
You believe that?
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
But she does work here?
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
Who is it?
Who are you?
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
Morning, Sunshine...
No.
Gotta go.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Unlikely.
Only one I can think of.
Not right now.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Who are you?
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
She's got my word.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
You left out condescending.
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
She tells you how I've been--
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
She was the one--
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Huh?
You love him?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
What's that?
Whoa... she is a killer.
Beth? I can't believe it.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
We've got to take this slow...
Ann Arbor?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
Sunday, but...
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
I think we should try sneaking in.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Jam, listen up.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
I got...
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Mom, what're we...?
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
I did?
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Are you AFRAID?
Hi... what's going on here?
What happened?
Dr. Monnitoff?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Like a DeLorean.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
I'm not following you.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
You have a request?
What happened to your eye?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
How old is Grandma Death?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Donnie?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
We're moving through time.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
What? How long was I asleep?
Did you call the cops?
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
People aren't that simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
So how was school today?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
So, I met a new friend.
Follow him where?
Do you think a lot about girls?
What else do you think about during school?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Where are we going, Donald?
How is that possible?
Why would I tell Mom?
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Rose.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Loretta, don't do that.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Go on! Get out!
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Here, I didn't get any.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
And the bite marks on my ears?
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
Okay... well, bye.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Dakota.
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Oh! What is it?
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Who to?
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Here I am, Father...
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
That was for you.
What other job you got?
I don't wanna work at all.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
My card.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Anything else? 
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Are you getting tired?
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
Oh, Rufus!
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
Like this. 
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
I want him back!
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
Treves. Well done.
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Good day...!
Alas, no.
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
How awful for John.
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yes!
Hello...
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
Righteousness for his namesake.
You look splendid, John.
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
Ohhh...
Who are they of?
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
You want a dressing bag, John?
...my... home?
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Yes sir.  What's that?
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
HE'S GONE!
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Pardon me?
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
WELCOME?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Halfdan the Black.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
Erik. You don't understand.
How do we know this is the way?
How?
Would you like us to sing to you?
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
A lot of people like our singing.
But you don't want to hear it.
No. 
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
I don't suppose... no...
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
You told them I raped you -- why?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
What?
You talking piffle, son?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
I want to die...  No, I don't!
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
You mean we'd be dead?
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
No! Let go, Snorri!
You'll be sucked down too!
You need to say a bit more than that!
I think we should go...
Well, what else do we do?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Sven!
Yeah... well...
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
How did he do that?
Vanish into thin air?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
Same thing, isn't it?
Can't make enough axe-heads!
My brother blacksmiths!
Sh! Hurry!
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
You've lost your mind.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
And you've got BOTH axes?
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
You weren't supposed to see that.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
Ms. Kruczynski?
Oh, baby, what's going on?
Come up to Boston with me?
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
How are you today?
Why what?
Really?
It's okay, really.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I can't remember.
I'm sure you would.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
It's okay.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
I'm not a stalker.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Well, I should probably get going.
No. I --
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Yeah.
Let me drive you home.
How can you watch this crap?
What?!
So, um --
You're drunk.
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
You remember what happened next?
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
I scoured the city for it.
I told her today I need to end it.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Cool.
I think I should go back.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
What took you so long?
Yeah?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
How's it going?
I just got in.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Naomi.
Okay. I wish you could come.
So what's going on, Joel?
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
I'm sorry.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Boo.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
Hey.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Order me a pastrami for after?
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Well, where was Patrick?
Mary. What are you doing here?
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
The voltage looks fine.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Yeah?
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
You're political, then?
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
That's Jellybean!
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
No, I guess not.
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
What do you think?
Are you in show business?
You're the best?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
We have a man down...
Will it work?
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
It's holding... She's holding...!
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
You weren't there. I saw it.
Is that an offer?
How? The Bridge is gone.
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
What's wrong?
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
What's the hold up?
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
Can anybody hear me...
Peters...
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
The "Other Place," what is that...?
What about my ship?
I told you... She won't let you leave...
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Weir is dead.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Captain Miller...
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Thank you.
Where is it, where is it...
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
Oxygen is not the problem.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Maybe one of the original crew?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Weir can't be alive.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
No. I saw nothing.
He's engaged the override.
Where is she?
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
A straight line.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
You look like an eighties rock band.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
What do you want, Vic?
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
How long was I out?
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
We're working as hard as we can --
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
What?
This is wrong in so many ways.
Back it down, Johnny!
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Leonard, how's the feed?
How's the IPO?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
That's good. That's uh... good.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
It's just business.
Victor, your scar --
You said it was urgent.
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Easy, mon.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Does Mom know you have company?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
What's wrong?
Take that back.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
All right... where did you see her?
Hey, Rat.
Yo.
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Are you Linda Barrett?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Are you going to ride that wave?
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
You'll always remember your first time.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Where's Doug?
I couldn't make it in time.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
You better save some for me, you swine!
What's that?
If you graduate.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
Thanks for picking me up.
Where do you feel like going?
How about the point?
That's a nice shirt.
You keep them.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Do you know what you want?
No. That's okay.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
John Bonham?
Really?
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Naked!?
Naw!
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
I want to leave fast.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
What limes?
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
What tape?
I want that fucking radio!
Jesus.
The cops?
You degenerate pig!
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
What is this?
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
Extract of pineal!
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
So do we, lady.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
May I see your license.
Could I have that, please?
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
What?
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
Stop!
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
Careful.
I will not die because of him!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
I don't think you should...
Wha?
We'll be food, dickheads!
What tunnel? Where?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
We're better off.
Why do you take shit from him?
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
How are you holding up?
Push and twist, it's child proof.
What is this?
Will I go crazy or something?
Um-hmmm.
What do you mean what?
What's it for!?
Four door?
Max?
Nine?
Fine, Chief.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Shit!
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Hey!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Let's move.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Get to your cars!
Her name is Charlie.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
Hello, Harold.
A rich actress.
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
...Don't you?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
You wrote it, didn't you?
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Are you... are you hungry?
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
Name?
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
How'd I look?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
What?
You don't know what you want.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
I know what ability you're interested in.
Serious, huh?
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
What for?
Take a walk, pal.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Where are we, mean man?
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
What a man!
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Where to?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
That would be okay.
Shit!
What?
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
You think I got it?
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
How long will you be?
At one. Promise?
Don't... talk crazy.
Haven't you heard what I said?
Oh, just leave those things for now.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
Yes...?
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Huh?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Why?
It can't be as bad as that.
Come warm yourself if you like.
And if I consent?
Why... her?
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
You dance so beautifully together.
Nothing. Still nothing.
This feels... incestuous.
I give you my soul...
Victor. I love you,
Victor!
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
Are you having me on?
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
They just caught the man who did it.
They'll hang him all the same.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
That's blasphemy!
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
Yes? And?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Professor Waldman.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Creature? A... human like creature?
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
The killer is still out there.
Any particular reason?
Next Friday.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Oh, my God...
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
Filmmaker.
It still hurts?
It sounded like Brenda.
What's the matter with it?
I'm sorry.
Sure.
I wouldn't know.
Claudette...
Give me a hand?
Holy shit...
Ha!
It's gonna be a long summer.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
It's just a dream.
Mmmmmmmph?
It's beautiful...
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
How much do I owe you?
What is your purpose in Mexico?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
What's this guy's problem?
Have you forgotten about your sister?
Why did they block the door again?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Not a chance.
Who's this?
Died instantly?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Was? As in not anymore?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
What did you call me?
It's the bitterest of pills.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
Not good enough, swear to God.
I'm going for 'em!
What's going on?
Mexico.
Do what?
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
See ya.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
-- see this, television!
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
I never said help us!
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Best in Mexico.
Yeah?
Gotcha!
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Where's the woman?
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Richard!
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
I'm lookin' scared?
You know what you look like?
I'm here with you.
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
But are there... I mean, how many...
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
Permission to leave, sir?
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Aw, what is this...
Ah, c'mon...
Shit.  Think we're had.
White House boys want a private meeting.
Hardly the case, Senator.
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
Can't complain, ma'am.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
Just do it, okay?
Come on, Montgomery...
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Jordan...
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
So why are you telling me this?
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
No shortage of suspects.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Say again, sir?
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Do you?
O'Neil...
Clear.
We're fucked.
Thought you two were file-closed.
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
I like that image.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
My God. He's going after the nest.
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Circuits are overloaded.
Are you okay?
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Your old sweetheart?
Can I use some?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
I can't.
Hence the radiation.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
I'm sorry about all this.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
They didn't make it.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
What sample?
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
You gave them the tape?
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
"The show must go on."
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
What?  What?
He's a twit!
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
What's happened?
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Yes but, we were wondering-
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Brandon.
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Okay, we got it.
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
No, wait, are you-
Go. They're off again.
Structural damage at 68 percent.
What's the weather like outside?
U.... What do you think?
A hologram...
No, I'll kill you. .
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
Where are the miners?
Oh, they're so cute.
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Your last name.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
Hi everybody.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
~e're alive!
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
What?
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
But I'm the Commander!
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Thank God. Are you okay?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
You gotta admit, they do love him.
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Theramin.
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Former Commander?
What's going on?
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Let's do it, Tommy.
Find them.
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
Arnold!
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
I hope I never have to believe that.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
Who is that!?
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
You think that?
Partially...
Unofficially, General Greene.
Any word from Canada?
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
But, you do come from a military family?
A horseshoer?
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
You hear that?
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
What is this?
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
You see the paper?
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
About sixty.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
You gave him the money?
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
You know how to write one of these?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
I'm working on a few things.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
The airport.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
What?
You say look at you?
Who the fuck are you?
Get in line, bro.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
You make movies, huh?
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
That's it? That's your movie?
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
One of his best parts.
She looks familiar.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
Here's your keys, Harry.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Really.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Yeah, he told me.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
It was in the Herald.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
One we're producing.
Very nice...
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
Yeah?
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
Harry... My God...
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You sure?
You okay?
Were you scared up there?
You don't act like it?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
What's wrong?
How did you get in the house?
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
What's so great about Sweden?
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Maureen.
Maureen.
You think that's funny
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Smokes?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
If you get it back in one piece.
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Sounds like the hull.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I think you know.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
What's slow?
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
You mean, before she sank.
Then why didn't they take it.
Any dizziness?
Headache, nausea, lights?
You okay?
Coffee?
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
The what?
What, like some kind of ghost?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Murphy, goddamit.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
I heard that.
I don't know.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
Say what?
Oh, man.
It's a Noaa buoy.
Can't find the shotgun.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Someone from the past.
Maxine.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
Pumpkin, are you in there?
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
What are you trying to say?
Who is this, Enid?
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
I...
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
It's not optional!
Are you the one who left that note?
When did I say I hated you?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Oh, hi...
Okay... I promise.
God, what a bunch of retards...
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Why?
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
Much later.
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
I want to "make love" to him.
It's obviously him!
He's insane!
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
Where are we going?
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
I'll bet he never jerks off...
What was that all about?
I know a party we could go to...
It's a surprise.
Give me all your money, bitch!
That guy is totally amazing.
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Don't you want nice stuff?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Why? What did he say?
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Do you want anything?
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Go die, asshole!
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Yeah, sure, I guess...
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
I'm totally serious!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
It's not hopeless...
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
What is that?
What, like a girdle?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
Just someone so young...
No, of course not.
Where did you get this?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
Yeah, well... me neither...
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I agree.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
I have no idea - I just want to...
Thank you, doctor.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
Starting now, we attack them.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
You've never built in Africa.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
It hasn't been that simple so far.
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
We need to talk.
Think about something else.
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
I'll have to.
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
Soon. 
You like him, don't you?
Afraid of lions.
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Where do you go next?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
What are you working on, Egon?
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Hello, Peter.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
You're really good, you know.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
I'm not even good for me.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
That's quite a story.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Well, good night, Louis.
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
I command you.
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
So far so good.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
I'm Egon --
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
And now you're going to eat it?
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
What's your story, Pete?
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Does it have any favorites?
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Uh-huh.
Damn!
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Great rehearsal.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
Did you see it?  What was it?
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
I want you to have this. 
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Great!  How's it going?
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
Circle?
Nervous?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh!  You're here.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Who?
Sorry, Buddy!
Set entry grid.
What happened??!!!?
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
Anything!  Just make contact.
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
For what purpose?
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
So do I.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Third floor.  Get down here,
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
For the gods, spit it out!
Tribuus... tomorrow.
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Then you'd be out of a job.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Where is my family?
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
Give away food?
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
Where is my father?
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
I've read of it.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
You cannot die.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
The Senators admire you.
As soon as I can.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
He's very realistic.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Who the hell are you?
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
How much money is involved?
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
Hello.
Do you want some dinner?
Why not?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Is anything wrong?
And it's all over now.
All right.
Where are you meeting this person?
-- really incredible --
I want to ask you a question.
I said I think it is.
Please let me go.
Don't you have it on?
The marble?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Carl who?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Oh no. He said that.
The day after tomorrow?
Benjamin?
Ben.
You a student?
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
You're not one of those agitators?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
What did you do to her?
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
BENJAMIN?
Well here's the purse.
I'd rather not.
Where are you?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Is anything wrong, sir?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Where is your luggage?
Sir?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Thank you.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
What do you think of me?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Sit down, Benjamin.
No.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
What is wrong with me?
I think I'll go to bed.
Then why do you keep running away?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Don't be nervous.
I want to say something first.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Yes, I do.
Benjamin?
Did you get us a room?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want me to get it?
Yes?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Wood or wire? They have both.
Thank you.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Oh.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
Always?
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
Well how did it happen?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Don't talk about Elaine.
I wish you'd tell me.
Good.
I have my reasons.
No.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Well, I'm not.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Did I say that?
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
But it's not.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Drive down the block.
I don't believe you.
Braddock -- Braddock?
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
I do.
You believe me, don't you?
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
They don't know?
When did you two talk this over?
I'm just --
I guess -- about my future.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Thank you.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Now look -- please --
No, I don't.
HUH?
Benjamin -- where are you?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
Turn 'em up.
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
No --
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
I've quit.
He must be very nice.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Oh!
Reducing?
Too bad.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Nothing -- only to be here.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
Yes -- tired...
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
Why do you smile?
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
Grusinskaya --
You do believe that I really love you?
Very early in the morning.
Till then.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Well -- last night was not so good.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Any letters?
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang... 
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Please -- please!
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Moreover...
You...
You...
I understand you perfectly.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Tomorrow morning.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Can you pay some attention to me?
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
No water -- What a place!
I know you did -- I said you did --
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Shall I tell them again?
You see -- what we are interested in --
You're a deep one.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Let us cancel the engagement.
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Take them back, Suzette.
Hurry, Suzette.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Good morning, Pimenov.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
Your what?
Motherhood.
You're calling the shots.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
You want a drink?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Not much time.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
What? Me?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
I like those.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Going somewhere?
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
For God's sake, Lilly!
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Roy?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Working the what?
You're on the grift. Same as me.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
Nobody does that single-o.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
Take a hike, you mean?
You -- I don't know.
She didn't see you, in other words.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
You watch that mouth.
I realize this is a shock.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
Where?
I can be real stiff.
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Carter.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Carter.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No shit?!
Jimmy, what are you doing?
No.  Wait for the police.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
You're twisted.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
It's an option.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
He found you, didn't he?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Not me.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
You really think Eddie killed her?
Linda!  He killed Linda!
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Who?
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Thanks!
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
Promise?
See what I'm talkin' about?
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
What do you know about Michael?
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Home is important to a man.
Home.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
What's funny about that?
You told me.
I didn't know we had any women left.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
Hi, Penelope.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Hello.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Blue soup.
Insurance!
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Anybody home?
Sir?
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
College!
Excellent!
It makes life spicy.
Oh hell.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
No.
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
You don't even know me.
What do you do for a living?
Some kind of animal?
What's that all about?
Your old beau?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Please--
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
You used to like it stark!
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
What then?
That's what you're supposed to say.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
Fish can't feel.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
The doctor.
And what is his most cherished possession?
And he keeps it in his apartment?
I came for my clothes.
I came for Paul as well.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
There's a certain amount of information there.
This is man to man.
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
You're old--so old.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
Hands and knees, you say?
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
Don Quixote.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
You didn't even find that out?
Alice is dead?
So long, you guys.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
I know.
Thank you, kind sir.
Not true.
A lot of people don't.
I don't really know.
Everything stays as it is!
It's fine!
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
Is he coming home?
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
Is that a fact?
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
No. I don't think so.
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
No, just not the type.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
What do you mean?
That's cool.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
Is this all the display space we can get?
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Nah.
Are you a private detective?
Of Joanne's?
Jesus.
And your wife? Where's she?
What's T-J?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
What the crap?
I can stop if you want.
Why do you say that?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Andy.
In G.R.? Why?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Yeah, sure.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Hey man.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Sounds all right.
Maybe. Maybe not.
The guy who bought you that ring.
You can fuck off, too.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Jake'll take care of me.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
How long have you been driving?
Okay, lady. Out.
But there is a family resemblance.
We planted it.
No.
Officer, I can explain.
Check.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Because if you are...
And what do you do, my dear?
How interesting.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Sorry I'm late.
Here's your shovel.
Do you sing and dance?
Yes.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
All right.
How about some ginger pie?
Me! No. Of course not.
No. 
What do you think?
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
What?
Why not?
No.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
I like Glaucus.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
No. I'd feel stupid.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
How about some candy floss?
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Mother.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
Would you like a cigarette?
Just give me a rough estimate.
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Yes. It does.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
You liked your teachers?
Your studies?
Then why did you leave?
What would you say?
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
You knew?
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
He... he loved me.
I knew you'd come back.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
What do you mean?
I'm scared.
Well... G'bye.
Where am I?
Steve...
Who?
I need to touch it to "see"...
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
Who's the squirt?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
She's dead.
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Myers?
Anything else you --
Are you sure about this?
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
It's freezing, isn't it?
That you feel that way about me.
Hit me.
Christ!
Will you sign for the bed?
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
We want the man who did this --
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
Come to Daddy.
You bastard --
This is what began it.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
You can't love him.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
What happened?
Sure.
Kirsty? It's very late.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
How are you doing through there?
You're NOT going to faint.
Take it slowly.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
I'll be down in a minute
Is this upsetting you?
Are you all right?
Dead.
Drinking alone.
What are you drinking?
Is this your place ?
First time for everything.
You're awake. Good girl.
I'll get the doctor.
What a pretty tune.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
You wouldn't believe me.
Who's there?
Where are you?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Big house.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Yeah.
I guess.
He's gone.
No you don't.
Get the fuck out of here.
We're on the Cointreau.
Not that late.
What do we do if there isn't?
I beg your pardon?
If I make it through the day.
What's wrong?
What?
Nice, Barry.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
What?
What are you snickering about?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
My band.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
Isn't it?
Fuck off, Barry.
Like fuck you are.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
Why not?
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
What?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
Anna.
Where's Rob?
What are you talking about?
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Good weekend?
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
I always hated this song.
Rob --!
Well we rang $900 today.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
I dunno.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Shit!
Hi.
Are you coming home?
-- Alright, alright but --
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
I don't know.
It sounds stupid.
Is it better?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Are you still in love with me?
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
You know I'm a good person.
Sure they are.
Hello.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
I'm sorry.
What?
You know, with Ray...
Look, we can do other things.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
More confident, maybe.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Where?
Just local, of course.
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
So?
About what?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
So you live in Chicago now?
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
That way.
I'll call you.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
This is against the rules.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
It's not mine.
Byzantine?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You have an active imagination.
Jesus Christ.
Why not?
He was innocent.
No.
Is this what you killed them with?
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
Who are you?
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
I did at that.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
You feel you know me.
He told me there could be only one.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
It is the truth.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
Why does he want to kill me?
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
I'm your future husband, remember?
Oh please.  Another one.
Something pretty.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Equals?
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
You see Major?  You are not so different...
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Spare a chair?
How are you?
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
I haven't drunk this much since-
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
Tradition.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
All I need is time.
Are you back?
Who is it?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
I'll keep you in mind.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
Did you finish the interview?
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Oh, she was here.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Just for the first year.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Well, I'm independent, too.
Well, she'll know some day.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Hello, Hildy!
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
You can break it, can't you?
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Afraid? I should say not!
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
Allow me.
What now?
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
She jumped out of the window.
All the words you've got.
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Railroad tickets.
What happened?
Ring that number, will you?
Don't open that!
No!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
What!
It'll be Heaven!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Anything you want, Boss.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Let's see the money.
They're always after me for interviews.
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
I call. What you got?
Who locked the door?
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
I'll call.
Goodbye, Yonson.
Gus, this --
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
Where'd you get this?
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
We'll fix that, too. 
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
A sight for sore eyes!
Got you, Williams!
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Have you got my dough?
Here!
Hiding him where?
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
What's that?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
Are you all right, now?
What do you want?
How much do you make a week?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
Why not?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
Is it hard?
Here's the picture of my wife.
Look out!
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
What's your hurry?
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
The door was locked.
What's that?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
You want to join our gang?
Bloody.
I did see them. I did.
Crocodiles! Aah!
You said that last year, Dad.
Who pays for them?
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
What is it?
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
What about it?
So you're going to be a grandfather.
We all had to write a last letter home.
And what's that?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
He always knows.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
I can't do it. What's the point?
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
He could always make me laugh.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
What did I do to deserve this?
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Who's your Daddy!
Which way?
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
How much further?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
What?
He walks, duh.
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
What's this?
How long have you been running this place?
No, really.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Really fucking awesome.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Just grin and bear it.
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Go around him.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Drive through it!
Fascinating.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
How long is that gonna take?
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
Why?
Yeah?
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Rise and shine.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
I don't hear anything.
Jesus Christ.
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
God damn.
What'd ya got there?
Open up the trunk.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
Just back up.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
Where is he?
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Well hello, officer.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
We gotta break it open.
Jesus Christ.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
What?
Please. I look a mess.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
Very well.
You what?
He's dead.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Progress!
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
My brother says he likes you, too.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
Yeah?
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Be still my crotch.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Done!
I'm going to miss you.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
It looks wonderful.
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Oh, and the sun block?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
Did you see that?
I don't know. Something.
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
How's work?
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
So he's doing okay?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
Extra dessert?
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Mother?
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
I'm ready.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
And a fact is a fact.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
How much?
How much do I owe you?
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
For me.
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
Man named Turk Baker?
Sign up.
Thinking about what?
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
When do I raise the bet?
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
Tell her what?
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
You name it, we shoot it.
The expensive kind.
Whaddya mean?
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
In the gut, I mean.
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
With what?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah, that's what I think.
What time?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Gimme ten bucks.
Hi.
How much are you ahead?
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Try me.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Do you always ask so many questions?
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
What do you do on the other days?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
I could always get us a bottle.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
You got it all in your head?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Well, he owns things.
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Your shot.
You name it.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
That is not now, human!
Do you remember where you lived?
Yes.
Who is this?
You want to find them.
What choice did I have -- ?!
I only protect myself -- !
Humans.
That's who you are too, Emma.
You want me to stay?
Do you still want me to stay?
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
You and that damned garden.
Need some gas?
Only got one kind.
So, what do you do?
We're going to be moving, son.
What's that, Dad?
Why, Dad?
There are more this year than last.
... and Rigel.
It was so real, Dad.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
Damn.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
I have school.
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
You're being paranoid.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
What do you want me to do?
Just my luck, no ice.
You still believe in him.
Better be. You left me for him.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
We're losing them.
What're you talking about?
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
You still got the Olds?
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
Dad, please...
Pops, you're a genius!
What're you doing?
Nice meeting you.
Is my wife in the air?
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
A meteor?
It's doing what?
He's trying to impress you.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Dick-weed!
Dick-weed.
Your son.
Oh. Sorry.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Mr. President?
Call them back.
Why did you people come here?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
The Word of God...
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Doctor Jones?
It must be one of these...
I said go around!
Uh-huh.
All I have to do is squeeze.
Dad!
It is you Junior!
Through the library?
...you did it.
They want my diary.
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
What does that mean?
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
What did you find, Junior?
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Why are you trying to kill us?
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
You understand what he tells us?
You have insulted my son.
What's that?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
Indy, look!
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
No, the stones are mine!
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
What'd he say?
What do you mean -- how?
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
Not leftovers?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
What?
I want to go home...
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
Give me your hat...
My name is AL.
Where are you,...Al?
Somebody's been here.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Who are you?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
Of course you do!
I wouldn't say that.
I want out.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
Door's locked.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
That's not a good idea.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
It's illegal.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Holy shit!
Now what?
I don't want to eat it.
Help me out, will you?
Wait.
Where is she staying?
Touch her.
It worked.
Yeah. I did it.
What did that cost?
They both look good to me.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Just don't show fear.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
What is it?
And on my time.
You been had. We have.
On what?
Where are you going?
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
One of your instincts?
What are you doing?
It's him.
Left...The one with the red dot.
Aim just in front of his face.
Holy...
There's a lot you don't know.
This may hurt.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
Awwww...
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
What kind of a deal?
PEM115!
How about a deal?
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
What brings you here?
Your memory.
It may have been affected.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
When you do...
Well...
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Who?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Don't do it!
What?
I'll be right there.
And you.
I can't do that?
Let you leave without it.
Wait. What's your name?
And you?
You again.
I waited for you.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
No. Ryuji just hires us.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Who else is interested in me?
What did you tell them?
Were you working for him last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
I'm leaving too.
This business is over.
You don't believe me.
What's Gruner like?
And Dieter.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
What?
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
What a mess.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Just like that?
It wasn't me. It was him.
What is it?
What could you find in this place?
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Yes.
The other working.
Ow?...
It will.
What's new?
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
P.J.'s.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
What does that do?
When's the air date?
Do you want more rice?
Yeah, I heard rumors.
What the hell are you doing?
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
I'm afraid you are.
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
A gun? Yes.
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Debbie...
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Is there any more rice...?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
...taping?  What are you taping?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
What's wrong?
What?!
What are you and Mike going to do?
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Area code 212-555-0199.
Yeah, I'm here.
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
So, is everything okay?
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
Lowell!
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
Who's that?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
You believe that?
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
You greased the rails!
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Where are you, anyway?
What are you talking about?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
"I would bet on it."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object to the form!
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Hello.
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Baby. You are so HOT!
No!
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
You're in check.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
What?
He's the wrong man.
I'm happy for you, pal.
I have it.
Marylin! What have I done?
So who'd you hire?
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
I begged you to have a baby!
You're vulnerable.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
How nice.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
How do you know?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
To victory.
Marylin? When did I say...?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Hmmm...
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
Apparently she was very disappointed.
And here I thought my mother was...
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Honey, I could sit...
Hi.
I have a surprise for you.
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I want to nail you ass.
Hello?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Sweet.
Do you need a Tagamet?
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
Miles Massey.
You're not...
Wait. I know you.
Herb wants to see me?
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
That's delusional.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Where does that leave us?
Mr. Rexroth.
Ah.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
Berry spoons.
Wrigley?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Three is not Farrow.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
What ten thousand?
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
South America!
You only met him once .
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
Please don't shout.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
Fine man to fall in love with.
Why should she? After all?
What about that diamond wrist watch she had on梥he can raise some money on that?
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
What happened?
Don't want to talk to梔on't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
No.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
What happened?
Why, no桰? Yes . . . I guess I will.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is? You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
That's right. You didn't.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do條eap for joy?
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Where'd you say the showers梐nd things梬ere? 
Must be the Spring.
Detectives!
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Not a one.
But what!
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
What are you thinking about?
Really?
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Carrots.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke梐nd hungry梐nd everything looks black. It's a long movement like this? 梬ith a follow through.
Here comes a car!
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
You might give me a little credit.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on?
That's swell!
Better go back to your bed.
Congratulations.
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and梐nd scared.
I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed? Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tired梐nd it's the only thing around.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady?
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff梞uch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
You're drunk.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
Not a minute!
Huh?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
Yeah梩he "big boy"梩he Boss of the outfit.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Right.
And Oswald?
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
But why?
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
What's it look like, Nick?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
...Oswald?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
It leads farther than that.
What do you mean?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Who was paying you, Dave?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
I want the truth.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.
Let me show you his picture. 
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Did they live?
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Get a hold of yourself.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
Goddamn Sam!
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Jim Garrison?
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
And he never hit you before?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
That's all you've had all this time?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
Can I help you?
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
What's the problem?
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
How'd you know where he was?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
My pocketbook.
What's this?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
You gain weight?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
No, you didn't. What branch?
What'dya think?
You get a chance to use it?
What, I couldn't hear you?
Who is this?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
Does it happen to all men?
Who was your girl before Annette?
You talk them into it?
Will Ordell go for that?
He was here?
You think he's got a thing for you?
Has he hinted around?
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Did you do it that night?
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Ray wants him.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
He's already there.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
I thought you were tired of your business?
Sometimes every day, for a while.
He say is a surprise.
You know what we want.
You said that the last time.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
What about you?
Oh, hi.
How long you been with Ordell?
What were you two fighting about?
Are you getting that black suit?
For what?
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
And what was your answer?
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
How the fuck they know that?
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
I was there, I saw her do it.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
Who's paging you?
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Want a hit?
How long?
Four years?
Want a Metrix?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
So where did you go?
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
C'mon, don't lie.
I lived there for about nine months.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
Please.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Thanks, Baby.
As low as two.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Whatcha watchin'?
Guess where I am?
Yeah.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
You shot Melanie?
Where did you shoot her?
Came outta where?
What'd you shoot her with?
I'm going out for a few hours.
Yeah.
What's his full name?
Beaumont Livingston.
Comfortable?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Where is it?
You know who this is?
You still there?
I'm alone.
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
Turn left.
We're back.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
You know, you got a strange line here.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
Well, try, huh.
What are you talking about?
Don't go.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
What do you mean, demons?
Not me, buddy.
I saw Sarah the other day.
A bit.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I can't relax.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
What are you doing?
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
They stole it.
Gee, thanks a lot.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Did you look around the headboard?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
I must have been out of my head.
What's in here?
What do you mean you can see?
What does it say?
He's coming right over.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Don't gimme that.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
Remember that.
I want to know. You tell me!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Who was that?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
Please.
Where have they gone?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
Why won't you answer me?
I don't know you.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
WHO ARE YOU?
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
You got a nice tan, though.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Clear the area. This is an order!
Dream on!
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
I'm sorry.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
His mother?
Minimal.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Hey! I'm not ready.
Kay-Em!
Goodbye, my love.
How many?
Earth II.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
What the hell are you doing?
Wait a minute...I need...
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
I'm with you kid.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
We need weapons.
Where is everybody? What happened?
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
What's this?
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
Rizzo, pull away!
You okay?!
That's really funny.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Kaboom.
I'll help you in.
I'm missing two!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
I didn't say I was good at it.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
It's just you and me, then.
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Something's wrong.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Jason? He's on this ship?!
Azrael can you repeat that?
You're not going anywhere.
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
Right.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Can you stand something to eat?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
She's right.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What's that?
How can you tell?
What is all this stuff?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Where'd you get all this?
What happened?
You all right?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
What day is this?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
You picked her up on the ferry.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
You from around here?
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
I'll drink to your leg.
Coming right to us!
You know how I feel about her.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
So, what do you think we should do?
Jesus, Bleek.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
We could get back together too.
I don't like Katrina.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
What, you mean as friends?
I try really hard, actually...
Can we make out now?
Hey man.
What a trip, man.
What is your job title, exactly?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
No.
Cool it.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
Like what?
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Hello?
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
I'm leaving Vanessa.
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
You should try Adderall.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Oh my God...
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Juno? What's going on?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Who is the kid?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
What?!
Or...
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
The Penny Saver sucks.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You guys are playing music?
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Juno, what's the matter?
She answered our prayers.
Like what? Be a rock star?
Have you found a place to stay?
Hi, I'm Adele.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
You took this picture?
Happy birthday Adele.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Shush, Adele.
What the hell is this stuff?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
This guy killed a mess of people.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Sure.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
What did he sound like on the phone?
I like that.
Up yours.
Who said he's my good buddy?
What's that?
There's more...
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
You were plenty hot.
...Janitor's job.
His Parole Officer.
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
It is right.
I hate this game.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Yeah. Why you give money.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Nah.
Casper.
Casper, where is he?
You sure?
Hey.
Yeah. Come on.
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Uh huh.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
I'm nervous.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
You know what I want to do?
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
Telly says was up.
The pain. The fucking pain!
You didn't?
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Wish me luck.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
Do you know where he went?
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
Yep.
No. I was just kidding.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Not too late.
Hello?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
I can't man.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
The door was open.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
You got it on the board.
You're a lying bastard!
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
You alright?
What is it?
Why does he call Sanderson?
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
We'll find the evidence.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Hello, Peter.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
And -- what path is that?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
You know her?
Just for that no hint today.
How?
Have you any idea what the message is?
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
Please... wait.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Now what?
It worked out alright, didn't it?
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Congratulations, dad.
Who told you that?
What is it, dad?
It isn't Kathy.
Anything?
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
Where were you last night?
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
Bainbridge Books.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
Are you with the tournament?
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
They couldn't break the riddle.
I think it's interesting.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
You have to win every point, don't you?
Doesn't that scare you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
You.
Nothing.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
Exactly.  It's the key.
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
You're right.  The killer told me.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
Lyssa ...
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Will your power outward.
Yes.
They have Lyssa!
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
There is nothing.
But you suspect.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
I road them often in my youth.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
Fame.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
And where do you lead, boy?
When did you last sleep, boy?
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
Go. I command you.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
We meant only to please you.
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
He will not!
He will come for me.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
A fine match.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Modred! Impossible!
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
She has the power of vision.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
Kegan!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
You see?
Knowledge.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
You will come with me.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Wow! It's brilliant!
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Stop. Everyone is looking.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
Poor darling, and then?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
You say it just to calm me!
How are you, Miss?
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
...Composer.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
This smells good.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
Are you a preacher?
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
There's no reason.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
What did they ask?
Doubts?  About what?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Red flags man.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
Shit!  He jumped!
Well, hello.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
Perhaps there's another route?
It has to be a full character's name.
Are you firing me?
Where?
Phileas Fogg?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
I don't have kids.
How are you feeling?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
What do you want?
Coffee?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
You're pretty drunk.
Do you want to fuck now?
If I was I'm sorry.
What's up?
Thank you. What time is it?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Yes.
Sera you are crazy.
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
What was that all about?
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
You know I love you... yeah?
What did they look like?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
But it's a top three school --
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
No!
What's going on?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Dewey Newcomb?
Come again?
I'm sorry, but --
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Yes?
I think so...
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
Good one.
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Uh -- family.
The idiot speaks.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
I'm a bitch.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
You're pawning The Rock?!
We still love you. Sisters forever!
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Don't ask.
Aside from that.
Why?
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
What the hell is that for?
You really think I'm attractive?
Whoa -- Why?
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
No -- it's just -- not me.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
How could this happen?
What're you doing here?!
Yes? Ms. Woods?
I did?
Class schedule, map, book list.
You're beautiful.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
Of course.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
You got into Harvard Law?
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Thanks for the backup.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
Why?!
Fool's magic.
We come watch... we come watch...
We watch... good fun...
My generosity is not so large as that.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
You're magnificent.
God protect me.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Damn you!
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
I meant no disrespect.
It's bluebells!
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
What do I do?
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
Worse than the battlefield.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
One more turn...
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Will you explain what's going on?
Can't we move any faster?
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
We seek to undo the curse.
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Aye... my Lord...
But you did... you did!
I detest serpents.
What shall we do?
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
He did run?
Its powers are strong.
My lady mocks me.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
I can't see a thing.
Step lively now!
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
How do I get the horn back?
No!
This is sad news, be it true.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
I'd be honored.
Wondrously so.
That was in jest.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What's she doing?
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
In a dream.
And video games after!
When does George get to come see his house?
What's that for?
I put him to work.
Alyssa.
My mother would die.
Hey.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
Why are you so uptight?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Oh, yes.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
I hate to ask about a window.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
Maybe...?
Oh.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Thanks for the shower.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
You're here early today.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Because I live there.
I'm not going!
What are you doing?!
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
It bugs me.
I'm not doing it!
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Where is it?
Did you got through my pants?
You're too fucking late.
I'm not even listening.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
I took some of your Vicodin.
I know the feeling.
What would you like to be?
I wish you had told me then.
Are you talking?
I loved him too much.
After everything.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What kind of house?
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
Good for you.
I aimed high.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Ah!  Oh....
Lock the door behind you.
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
A blueprint spool.
I need to talk to you.
When's school over?
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
I did say he could go.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
What is it?
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
Let's not do this, okay?
Peter left me yesterday.
Are you going to kiss me?
I better get the kids home.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
To shave your chest?
The biggest waste of time since television.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
Despite you.
No.
Hey.
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
The door was open.
He's a big one.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Want me to come back some other time?
You know I trust you, Claude.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
What are they gonna do to us?
That's some long green.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
This fork is filthy.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
What does that mean?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
Don't mention it.
I know people.
You get ketchup?
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
Don't make me take them away from you.
You sure it was him?
No, I'm gonna kill him --
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
How you doin'?
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
What is that?
How about some steak sauce?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
What are you doing here, mama?
I can't take that, mama.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
Wait for the firemen!
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
What's your name?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Where is he? He's late.
Makin' friends already.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Come on. One more time.
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
It's freezing my hands.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
Valerie?
I think I'm floating.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
No.
You callin' me a thief, my man?
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
Answer the question!
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Why?
You missed something special.
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
What's going on, Logan?!
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Later.
You could have called me yourself.
Why show me?
Please? What friends?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Are you taking me to them?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
Don't!
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
Don't ever let go.
What does it mean?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
And Sanctuary?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
What belongs to the people?
How long have you been living here?
What kind of place is this?
How did you get here?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
That's better than gold when it's cold.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Do you own a video camera?
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
What's that, Ed?
Sure.
I don't know.
So, should I call Andy?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
You all right?
You killed him.
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Andy, who is that guy?
Dick Laurent?
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
Who is it?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
Who is this man?
He's not Madison?
That's it.
Something wrong?
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
Where's Alice?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
That's why I married you.
What's that?
From the club. You didn't answer.
You're up early.
Don't you want to watch it?
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Suit yourself, champ.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
Mr. Eddy?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
What do you want?
I don't know.
I was?
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
All of it?
What about those men we met this morning?
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Found in Asia!
Don't call me brother.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
I see.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
Certainly not.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Yeah. You know.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Chalmers Bryant!
Think of it! In times like these.
Huh?
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
And the wine - excellent.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Who?
Well, is it?
108 and still active?
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Oh, immediately.
As far away as I ever want to be.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Just what I needed too.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
What is it? Has he fainted?
He's dead.
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
Did I say "if"?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Let me up! Let me up!
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
Maria?
You say the porters are waiting for us?
The clothes?
What about the others?
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Where were you hiding?
That fellow got on at Baskul.
Good.
I guess we're in for it.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
What do you want him to do?
How about you? Do you want to go?
EXCUSE ME?
You shot an eight year old girl.
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
...touch that.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
I wasn't scared...
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
The radio show?
You think that's what's-happening?
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
What are you doing?
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
in case I need it?
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
When?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Found it.
Really nice wheels, by the way.
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Take it.
I have to go back.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
She grew up.
John?  What is it?
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
And replace them with new ones.
From where?  D.C.?
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
You the sentry?
Kill type?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
You the only sentry?
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
John --
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
Why did you catch that?
You're certain?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
Really?  You've never been inside?
If it's a question of authority.
But you call this room the "temple".
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
She's a precog?
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
What the hell.
You're alive?
Sean, wait...
Do you know who I am?
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
Let go of the gun.
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
You're talking about the precogs...
This is all my fault.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Lamar, I found something.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
We could have lunch together.
Raincheck?
This your work?
Cream and sugar.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
No.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Yeah.
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
I can take you down there.
What, sir?
So, wait, you're from where?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
Is he cute?
Should I fuck him?
He's great, right. Is he great?
I don't know.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
I feel weird asking him.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Whu --
Get your hands off of her.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
What's up? Jess ready?
What's his name?
So, when's the drop.
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Where's Ricky?
Not driving Jess, you won't.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
Yes.
You want --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
I can wait around if you want.
Yeah?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Sorry, man, but...
So, it was a draw.
How am I being shitty?
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
I'll page you with the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
He implied it.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
I gotta pick up the baby.
I like it.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Who you calling?
C'mon, man...
How much is it?
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
What exactly did they say?
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
What the fuck was that about?
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Nothing, man.
The penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
You did?
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
No. I'll wait here.
C'mon...
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
Where's the surprise?
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
You look good, man.
Yes.
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
No shit?
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
No, really, mate?
Yeah.
Good morning.
Yeah.
A lot of Persians?
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
Can I borrow a piece of --
Yes. You're going to New York.
Yeah.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Scotland.
I'll get it.
I'm working trains. Selling.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
How's it feel?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
I'll give you back the 600.
I'm wearing, Archie.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
What you say?
Who the hell are you?
You ain't lying.
Putting all that poison in your hair.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
What the hell for, man?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Where am I gonna start?
Little.
I will do it.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
Do you?
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
I'll be away a lot.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
Let's cancel.
Why don't you just ask your question?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
If you want to tell me.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
'Bout every other night, Red.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Let's go.
Did you hear me?!
Another one?
You're my father.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Yes sir.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
They talked about me like
What am I doing here?
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
Where does he live?
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
Deal.
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[Who pays you?]
[Who's the boss?]
[What money?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[How much do you want?]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
What is it?
You been working?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
You mean a misfire?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Potential? I don't understand.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Not at all?
And don't start crying.
They'll be back in a week.
Why do you ask?
Did you used to?
You're late.
You don't drink like you used to.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
You think too much?
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
You've done much of this work before?
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
Jordan!
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Creasy... Wait.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
It will be a hard break.
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[I know this. Your point?]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Marty...
No...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
I'm stag.
What?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
What time is it?
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
I said, is she Italian girl?
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
Sure.
Well...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Okay.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Tommy...
What are you going to do with him?
Stop him! Stop that man!
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
Wisconsin.
We got to stop them right here.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
When will he be able to write?
Never heard of him.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
We think the same way.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
Radar!
What for?
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Black capsule.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
For you, Trapper.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
But I'm married.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
They missed the boat.
You don't go after the local scrunch?
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
What's going on? Who started this?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
Sir?
Sir?
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Yeah?
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
What's the bastard really like?
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Who?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Ted Sheldon.
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well桰 don't quite know what to say . . .
That's good.
Oh.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
The Websters!
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
You made it up.
John Doe.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Well, maybe you're right.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
What do you do when you work?
Baseball?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
What do they want?
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
No!
It makes no difference, Bert梩he ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
I want it as soon as possible.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Well, I'm stuck with two and two梑ut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and?
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies梑ut stay out o' newspaper business!
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut and桰'll eat him.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
What are you doing up here then?
That's a lie!
No, I didn't write it, but?
Oh!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Hello, guys.
Apartment 306.
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Who's controlling your mind?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
Anything on Korda so far?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
You don't have to come here.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
You can't kill me like this.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
Recruited you from where?
How did you like Toronto?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
You have to. It's a tradition.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
We see each other every couple of months.
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
I can't do that.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
What's the first commandment?
You tell me.
To save lives.
You know why I like the track?
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
The 6 horse is last.
They need to run first and second?
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
We won.
What the fuck is going on.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
And what if you can't live with it?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Have you evacuated anyone?
You think I didn't need you?
What do you think?
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
There is?
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
Tell him to give me a raise.
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
I can't do that.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Roper...
God-Damn you!
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
It's all here...
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
Divinity?
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
You sure he's going to come?
Where you plugged-in from?
The woman you're stuck on.
He had keys.
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Two maze runners.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
Who did he digitize?
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
What brings you inside?
But I don't know anything about programming.
Why?
I wasn't with you.
What's so funny?
Program name?
We've got him locked!
He's on us!!
So how can we get to it?
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
... What's happening to him?'
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
That's pretty bad.
Release the power WITH the power.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
You okay?
That's the only way to the Monolith...
I'm in!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
SKULL!!
... A falcon?
Hey, boss!
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
What!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Boo-Boo.
Life knocked me back.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
You ain't even a man yet.
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
The deal's too good, Frankie
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
Same here.
You got something to hide?
Have you thought about this?
Charlie?
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
Who'll make the rules?
How soon can we pull this off?
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
You bastards, I said twenty!
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Come off it, Bugs.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
You boys carryin' pieces?
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
What the fuck does that mean?
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
We learn from life.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
Forget it. That's past.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
The Big Picture.
Where's the stiff?
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
What a cozy little scene.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Best we got.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Bitchin' good cake.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
Can't you give it to me later?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Stu...LOOK!
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
You know ...  ... whoops!
But I was dusting.
He seemed quite taken with you.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Mother!
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
You mean it's dangerous?
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
It was?
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Drunks are funny--
Yeah.
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
All right, why?
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
*But you never asked me*!
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
A pet shop?
Washington!
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Yes, I was--
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Y-yes.
Mr. President--
Mr. President--
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Hello, Jefferson.
Certainly would, Joseph.
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
What is it?
*No*!
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Pardon?
On paper?
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Letitia.
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
Hello.
A camp! Well!
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Oh--you are!
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Ax?
What! Who?
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Joe! You *told* him to!
I know that.
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
Yeah?  And what else?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
That's him. Let him in.
What do you think?
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
You can't say *that* to--
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Senator Paine will state it!
That's going to be fun.
Since he was born.
Most every day.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Oh, yes.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Are these the articles?
But they did take place?
Oh, thank you!
You are , aren't you?
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Tell me more about yourself.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Oh, I don't know.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I've often thought about going back.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
With pay!
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Did it?
How'd you get the picture?
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
What're you going to do?
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Gold, eh?
Is that the best you've got?
Come on, John. What happened?
Nuisance value?
It's a lie!
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Newspaperman?
Hang up.
That's pretty.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Look!
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie?
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
Why, it's an artistic institution?
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Look, he's temperamental.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Brookfield just came in.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
That ought to be fun.
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
Where is your farm?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
What do you think you're doing?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Why, that's an echo, sir!
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Shall I call the police, sir?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
That's a lot of people all at once.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
You do?
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Hiya, Doc.
Finally, some common sense...
Just who is here, can you tell me?
No.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
I'm not making any promises.
Mom's such a cutie.
Please... forgive me.
Is this the treatment?
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
You're doing great.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
So whose route is this?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
I guess you saw the show...?
Sofie...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
I've got three big ones.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
A doll?
Who else knows?
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Did you carry a gun?
But look at me now...
And a birth certificate is enough?
Psych major?
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
You know where he's taking her?
And what ritual would that be?
Altar boys?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
Goin' somewhere?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Immune from what?
What just happened?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
The key!? She has the lost key!?
You bastards!
No women allowed.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Yes.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
We're almost there.
For what?
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
You two!
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Got guts, lady.
You...! YOU...!
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
You lied to me!
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
Juicy?
She's my sister, actually.
Hey,... don't I know you?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
None taken.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
What?
We gotta get her back.
I knew you'd know.
Where are you going?
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
I thought you were done?
Do I?
We didn't think this through very well.
Atta, girl!
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
How about... the Savage Six?
No one will believe us.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Snap out of it!
He'll never make it.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
Are you with me... or against me?
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
It's me.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
GET MAD!
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
What's that?
But... only when no one is looking.
The Obliterators!
Yes, Obie-wan.
You guys going to a costume party?
Really?
Jeffrey!
You did?
Hi.
And there's the Sphinx.
To us!
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
That was too close.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
Ah -- you approve?
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
There are none here.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Ah-hh, no.
Hello there, Picart.
My God...!  What time is it?
How did it spread so quickly?
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
I know of no better time.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
When is she supposed to return?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Promise.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
How do you know?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
Can you give me a drink, please?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Come in.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Who are you?
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
What's the green stuff poking out?
It's about to work, just come on.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Who is that?
Man, this a cool house.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
Damn, you got a stalker.
Why?
So.
$247.
I ain't trying to get in it.
What we gonna do?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
What's the matter?
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
What it smell like?
You coming in?
Craig, remember what I told you.
What kind of activity?
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
What is it?
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Hey.
What?!  What that mean?
Where's Craig?
Tape his mouth shut.
Where did Craig move to?
What you say?
You too big.
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
What about that ugly dog?
My back.
Amtrack?
You just come in on Amtrack?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
I remember you...in the elevator.
Who did?
This? I've never even fired one.
Can we go now?
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
Yes, yes, I understand.
You're out of your mind.
I will do no such thing.
What about the gun?
Again.
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
We have to hurry.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
You got anything smaller?
It's a twenty.
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
Who?
Then why'd you drag me into it?
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
What am I supposed to say to her?
Well?
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
You have, huh?
It's under control.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
I'm looking for them.
That's enough.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Uncle Birdie!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Pearl dotes on him.
What could have possessed that girl!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Tell me a story, John.
Where's Mom?
Where are we goin', John?
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Don't you hurt her!
Where ye from?
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Now it's your turn.
How old are you?
Yes; John's bad.
John's bad.
About our secrets.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Get up, Willa.
Mornin', ladies.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
I been bad!
This man down at the Drugstore...
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
How long's this been going on?
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
It's just a stupid cat.
What the hell's going on!?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Guess I did.
You crazy? Hit him with what?
Rod's not a lunatic.
She dreamed this would happen...
Hello Nancy.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
She lived there.
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Where you think you're going?
You okay?
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Give me the key, mother.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
You feel better now, right?
When did you have a nightmare?
Well, a hat...
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Yes.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
What is it, Anna?
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
What a lovely room you have here.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
Guest?
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Good morning, Your Highness.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
Let's do that.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
If you want to see us you must come later.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
Bad news?
Yes, monsieur?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
Business.
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
I must get into that country of yours!
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Can I help you?
Why do you need my finger?
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Is that customary?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Do you hear that?
Was that talkative?
Room service speaking.
Will you smile?
Because we are an odd couple.
I wish they had never met.
I don't look too foolish?
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Our salute will be a kiss.
Would that make you any happier?
No music.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Is this the wish of the masses?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
Where are they?
You leave me no choice.
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Well... that's my business, madame.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Is it?
To protect his people.
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
McCord? ...
Where's Hunt now?
And?
We can't touch Hoover --
The country's loving it.
What about England?
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
Fucking hell.
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
What'd you say?
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
No.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
Oh, my goodness ...
We took his system out.
Kissinger?
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Why, you got a customer?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
No, Henry.  I don't.
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
... as the old alliances crumble.
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
He was a politician.
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
It was illegal, what he did.
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
How many?
Jesus Christ!
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
... give me a break, Mary.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
We lost ...
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
Dick, don't...
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
I'll do it.  No more.
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
He looked old, didn't he?
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Are you okay?
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
Won or lost?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
How come're you doin that?
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
No I ain't.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
Well. Old age flattens a man.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Yessir. It was punched out.
You gonna drive out there?
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
Don't get hurt.
No.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
What'd you give for that thing?
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Llewelyn?
What should I do?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I know where the money is.
And where is that.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
How'd you find it?
...I know where you are.
All right.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
Will there be anything else?
Now. We close now.
Yes I do.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
Call it.
Yes.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Tent poles.
You on all night?
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
Not that way.
Were you in Nam?
So was I.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
The heroin. You don't have it.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
How is she?
Could I have that in American?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Jesus...
Did you send anyone out there?
Bad idea...
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
No... what about your sister?
It's all right.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
George...
Thanks...
What're you doing here, Roy?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Yes.
Dr. David Ravell.
What are you doing?
It's something I had to do. For David.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Doctor David Ravell.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Looking for someone?
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Could you give us an example?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Like what?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
Relax, we brought the cash.
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
That was a really shitty thing to do.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
How'd they describe her?
We should go.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
What doesn't?
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
This is Betty at twelve.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
What'd you get her?
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Did Chloe crack?
You lie, motherfucker...
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
You can't do this -
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
That's right!
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Izzat right?
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Yeah, look at me.
Pete have a brother?
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Devil his due.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
The preacher said it absolved us.
Pete... I do apologize.
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
It was a powerful air.
She's at the five and dime.
You, Zack?
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
Hi, Byron.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Why?
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
What's your name, boy?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
Mayo, are those your friends?
What did you call me, boy?
No, sir!
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
Vietnam?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
You're sure it's okay?
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
That was you guys, huh?
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
He ask you out for next weekend?
Lynette, where's Sid?
And you turned him down??
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Yeah? Why're you here?
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
I vote for the motel.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Could you believe those girls!
What? You've gotta be kidding!
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Sid, what happened?
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
There is not one thing funny here.
Stop it!  Stop it!
Me.  I am.
Yes.
One.  Squeeze.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
Are you okay?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
Get the fuck away from me.
Bullshit.
The walls are steel, right?
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
They're not supposed to be here!
Where did you get this clown?
And we're never getting in.
I mean it!
Yeah?
'Bout four o'clock.
You don't look so good.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
Master bath.
Could the child please stop that?
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Suit yourself.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Makes me nervous.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
He's going down.
Yeah.
Oh, please.
Small space?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
We're never getting out of here.
Do it.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
What if I spazz out?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Tyrone...
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Alma I told you to...
Lemme see that rifle son...
What's up?
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Alone...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Motherfuckers...
My Mom's at that.
Yeah.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
When?
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
You don't know him very well, do you?
How did this... how did I let this happen?
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
We did.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Shall we proceed?
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
That is a separate issue.
Sir?
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
How can we end this madness?
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Have you seen any Redcoats?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
You learned her lessons better than I.
Cheraw Falls.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
You don't hate him.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
You were an Englishman then...
And your principles?
We saw.
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
How far away?
How many came back?
Gray.
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
Seventeen.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Honey, Church will be fine.
No-I guess not.
Huh?
Yeah, sure.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Was it Pascow?
Nice.
You folks ready to go on?
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
I'm not climbing that.
Doesn't look like they last long.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Can I have another one?
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
The movers--
She's finally asleep.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
I heard you tonight.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
You stole my boat.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
There's ... another exit?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Man overboard!
Did he speak?
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
You're speaking up for him again?
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
What?
If I had known --
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
You?!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Say again?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
Move away.
Not without my effects.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
No.
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
No.
He may be.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
He's still breathing.
How long do you leave him in there?
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Oh no?  Smell this.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
She says it's not.
Icky!  What's happening?
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Poppy, please --
Did you feel that?
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Hey!
Yeah?  So what?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
What did security say?
You were never invited to my house.
Of course, sir.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Sir, please try to hold still.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Susan!
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
The big house.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
... just like the mouse.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
What are these?
Why do we need it?
That was an egg?
Just look at it!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
What in the...?
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
You're not going after Argon!
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
May I use your telephone?
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and ?
Really?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
Do you like them?
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
Anne, come here. Listen?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
梐nd if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
What is this person doing here?
Fine. Have a seat.
This way.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
That's a canary, sir.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
The boss is getting hoarse.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
There you are?
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Okay.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Here you are.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
What other girl?
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
What is it, Smythe?
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
You try it.
It's haunted just the same.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Mary Sue?
Can I ask you a question?
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Like a drum.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
Sure you are.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
Oh yeah.
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
What?
But where would we go?
It's six-thirty ...
Don't! Just let go.
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
I think I've got something to say.
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
Dan! Arrest them!
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
What color is that hedge of yours?
No, not that hedge. The other one.
What are you doing?
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Noooooo!
You know him?
Can we do any better?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
How?
Can I open it?
I like calling you David.
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
Don't get upset.
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
I had nothing to do with that.
OW!
Hope you're proud of yourself.
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
Have you cooked the burgers?
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
Well don't you?
Oh, hi.
Dream come true, hunh?
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
Well, I can't talk though --
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
You look nervous.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Are you gonna do it?
Yeah I can't.
Goodbye.
You're so scared.
Hello, this is Back.
Yes.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
No.
Really?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
No.
...yeah....well you have me now.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Not very late.
Uh-huh.
Me?
So you think you can?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
They're not open yet?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
There's a piano in the street.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
You like her?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
....No....
No I didn't say that.
What happened?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
This is Barry.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
It's so nice.
How many times have you been on an airplane?
Yeah.
Are you ok?
I don't know.
I cut myself.
On my knife.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
The police are on their way.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
It's ok, take your time.
Who is this?
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
How's business?
Yeah.
Mhm.
It's alright.
Hey, good morning, Barry.
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Hey.
I need to talk to you for a second.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Yes I am.
I won't.
I know.
I know.
I know.
That's cool.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
I'll go pay for my car.
Yeah.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
Marquis? Is that you?
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
Go back to your room. Quickly.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Free his mouth.
I must grant him his last rites.
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Mightier than the sword indeed.
You mean to take us all down with you?
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
-- water! --
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
It's no secret that you loved her.
Don't confuse one organ with another --
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Go to hell!
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Well?
It was not inspired by circumstance.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
I'll do everything in my power --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
He'll do no such thing.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
Here it is; the last chapter.
I'll be waiting.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
"...your wife."
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
Good God, Marquise --
This is neither the time nor the place --
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
You're just scared.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
That poor woman.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You are repellant when you drink.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
He lied to me
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
What are movies about, Orson?
What are movies about?
Magic
Not for me.
Sigmund Freud?
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Oh for Christ's sake-
Mank-
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
I don't have it anymore?!
It doesn't have to be
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
What?
Jesus Christ --
I want you back
Hey, kid. Gregg.
Hedy Lamarr?
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
What have I done?
Oh God.
May I help you?
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
It came.
Very generous
You're going to destroy it
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
For the title
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
For Christ's sake, shut up--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
It was the best, kid
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
What's up, Colonel?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
J.R., glad you could make it.
You're a good sport, lady.
Sure. What is it?
Jack, I got no gloves.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
What?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
But you said "you."
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
I can't find my ball.
Jake...
Now take the rest off.
Huh?
That he's got a pretty face.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
No, you're his wife.
It don't look right.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
But I'm not a killer!
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Wrong day?
Something wrong?
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
That's normal.
That's abnormal.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
What do you think?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Maybe she died.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
Yeah.
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
From his landlord -- once a month.
I hate funny exit lines.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Wasn't that close?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Nobody chickened.
You know something?
Meaning me?
Just him.
I like you, you know?
How'd he get in?
You see any cops?
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
Except yourself!
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Where did you get the gun?
I'm here.
How'd you get here?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Come out come out wherever you are!
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
I'm sorry.
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
He called me chicken.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Okay--
Assault with a deadly weapon.
See, I'm new.
No--I was just--maybe--
Oh, Jim!
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Ever been in a place like this before?
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
Do you think your father means that?
That one?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
She's being called for.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
He wants the money.
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
You can't find... what?
Toys for... adults?
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
No, c'mon --
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Ashley, Jesus --
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
...the truck driver...
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
I thought we'd have a few more days.
They've never done a robbery?
So does it look a lot different?
Nick, what happened --
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
I love you, Nick...
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
No.
No, you can't --
Put him in the truck.
You're not Nick Mason...
So you could get with my sister.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
You knew the place --
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
What the fuck are you talking about.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
Got something to say to me, Nick?
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
NO.
You gotta be kidding me.
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
I can't go back to Vegas...
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
The Powwow Safe?
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
That motherfucker --
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
What about the money?
You knew there were guns in here!
Monsters in the gelatin...
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
She's using a new perfume.
Rudy, don't move --
Tell Ashley... I...
Switch seats with me.
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Without having them hit the alarms.
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Seymour Scagnetti.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
I don't know, but somebody did.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
Me and Mr. White?
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
What?
Tell me more about Cabot.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Jesus Christ!
Mr. Brown?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Myself and Mr. Pink?
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
You gonna put it away?
What's she doin' now?
What for?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
I know.
Your name's Freddy something.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
What're you talkin' about?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
What happened?
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
Gun shot.
Want a smoke?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
No shit?
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
You don't know how good it is to see you.
Anybody hurt?
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
Our kind of women?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
But the rest is right.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I can't --
How does she draw?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Why?
Can I have my gun back?
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
I can't take her with me.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
It isn't that --
But I want to stay.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
That something I shouldn't see?
What is it?
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
That sure smells good.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Suppose I take a look.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
We don't want to go there.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
I said let's go.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
You're so nice.
How about California?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
She was only teasin'.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Oh my God! We're dead!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Hello Brenda.
Where's Shorty?
Ray, run faster.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Where the hell are we?
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Cindy, let me...
What should we get?
Oh, right.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
I'm Cindy.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Stop touching his brain!
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Both of them?
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
Father!
I'm sorry.
Yo! That jacket is tight.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Here you go, Professor.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
I can do it myself.
Hello Dwight.
What are you working on?
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
Alright... I might need your help.
It's okay. I understand.
Yes.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
No thanks.
Yo son, check this out.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
What does it say?
"Fucked me."
Bring her home... I guess.
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
CHIP!!
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
He goes to college with me!
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
"P" as in...
Objection! Argumentative!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
Who is this?
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
It's him!
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Man, that one made me puke!
What is it, Betty?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
You can't tell.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
I haven't got that much in cash.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
And that was all?
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
What brought you down here, Greg?
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -?you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister 棗 whom I had lost and have found again....   
Do you think he knows about this?
Could you find him?
I'm tired of being afraid -?of waiting.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
And you knew he'd be here.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
And you believe that?
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one ?so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her -?he doesn't make her laugh 棗 he just sits and talks.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
And this poetry 棗 like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Perhaps.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
But you would like to know where she is?
I was a great dancer...
Is it about Jacqueline?
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
Yes 棗 yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
That makes it all the more difficult 棗
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
But he also wrote --
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
...free-lance. You know.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
I don't know.
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
So what about kids?
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
My therapist said that --
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
You just ask them questions?
How did you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
What will you do when the money runs out?
Tell me your name.
Yes.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Did you have sex before you were married?
I guess not.
No.
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
So you do fantasize?
Have you fantasized about me?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
On tape?
Can't.
That's correct.
Her name was Elizabeth.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
I've told you.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
But that was part of it?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Don't do that.
Because.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
What?
Why?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Goddam right.
Bastard...
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
What do you mean, like physically?
What brought this on?
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Do you want to leave therapy?
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
What are you talking about?
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Fine.
Questions about sex.
What!?
Because I wanted to.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
You couldn't do it, period.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
Here it is.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
How did you find me?
Doing what?
Then what happened?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
Who said I was jealous?
Hello.
John?
Hello.
Not today. I've got other plans.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
Plenty of room for two people.
Student?
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
IBM.
May I ask who's calling?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Is that the man who called you up here?
You say something?
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
What happened?
Yes? Who is there?
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
NIGHT NIGHT
How's Brad?
You got it!
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
But...how?
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
A free thinker.
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Care to indulge?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
But they only think they're happy.
Oh my poor baby.
I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
F for...
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
This could be worse than the old series.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And none of them worked?
Miles.
How's the trip?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
What do you think?
You got it.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Hi.
Highliner, please.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Anything I'd know?
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
That's your problem, Miles.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
That's what you do with every one.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Yeah. Tight.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Have you no shame?
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
She what?  When?
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Right now.
What the fuck are you doing?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
What do you think's going on?
What is it?
Fucker hit into us.
We're on.
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
What?
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
That's thoughtful.
What's it look like to you?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Please, Miles, please.
Me?
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
I'm having the salmon.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
What's the title?
Well...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Can I ask you a personal question?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Okay. See you around.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Hello?
Where are you?
Ken.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
French or American?
Sir, what are you doing?
That was fun last night.
What are you thinking about?
Daddy.
I think it's contaminated.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Explain, act crazy?
No I'm not.
It was very dark.
That roof is over ten feet high.
It's noise.
Where are you going?
We won't be able to get out of there.
I can feel air.
It's getting stronger.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Don't do it!
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
...Gotta go...
Where are we?
I almost didn't.
Gotta go.
Paden sends his best.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
Are you all right?
You're not Baxter?
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Jefferson City?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
What's Turley like?
Women?
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
I'll see you around.
Daddy?
Because they don't like what I want.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
You wanted to see me?
You can't do this.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
I got there just short of too late.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
He must be pretty good.
What about his brother?
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
I've given that up.
You got a place to stay?
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
What makes you say that?
How about you?
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
I can't wait to meet her.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Hair and make-up?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
Really?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Hello?
Mom, do you miss Dad?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
You look so, so...
You're with me to be close to her?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
For her?
Hal, what are you doing?
There's... a wall between you --
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
Is she here?
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
You have to see her.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
Hi, Dad.
Not quite how I imagined it --
There was no other way.
Can't you stop that?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
One thing bothered me.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
What now, Sayer?
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
Thank you.  It's not important.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
What if it catches on fire?
You mean they buy it?
Maybe he can.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
Why did you leave me?
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
I forgot your name.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
He hates me.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
Why?
You said the "s" word.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
What kind of words?
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Cats?
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
Dr. Crowe?
Just help.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
Don't go home, okay?
Where is she?
You see ghosts, Cole?
Yes, Cole?
How did you--?
...He doesn't get invited places.
Good for you.
'Course, it's none of my business.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
See?
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Gene.
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
You're out of your mind, man.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
So... what does it do?
Never heard of it.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Shit!
Yeah. That's just the problem.
Is that right?
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
What's wrong?
So?
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Suzie --
What are --
You're... limping.
Suzie... No.
No --
I almost thought for a second...
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
Like your guitar break.
Where's Mac?
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
And that makes you look like a squid?
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
What you up to?
Pretty, ain't they?
How about Brenda?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
No reception out here.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
What's she see in that douchebag?
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Meat.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
I never danced in a towel before.
Who's that?
When one sees you they all see you.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Get your hands off my daughter!
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
You got my barley pop?
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Kate McConnell.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
What the hell's going on?
Can I ask you something?
Jesus!!!
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
What kind of a guy is he?
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
Why should I?
I'm begging.
Order up!
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Why are we doing this?
Shit! No one's here.
Let's get the hell outta here.
I hate to say I told you so.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
Do I have a choice?
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Never mind. It's nothing.
We're outta motion lotion.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
I'm all ears.
Bandit II?
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
Is your security team armed?
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
He's giving them up?
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
Who?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Are you on a land line?
I've got concerns.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
What happened?
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
Do you want me to say I did it?
That's probably him now...
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
FUCK YOU!
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
My debrief --
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...Does he know?
...Are you insane?
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Wow.
Shoot.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
I'm working on it.
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
I DON'T KNOW!
I want to hear your version.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
That's fantastic.
You murdered her!
You fucking bastard...
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
How long can you go without sleep?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
Kelvin, you awake?
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
Not a very happy poem.
You go home.
You're better when you take them.
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
What happened to us, exactly?
Why did you say those things?
I like that too.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
He has a point.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
What are you talking about?
Why did she do it?
What's happening to us?
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
No.
You never said you wanted one.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
What are you taking?
How can you be here...
He won't do it.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Let's get a drink.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
You asked.
You could do better.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Claire?
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop being nuts!
You told her?
What do you want to do?
When can I see you?
Claire...
It wouldn't work.
I'll miss you, Mike.
I like your coat.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
She's got to identify him.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
I'd identify him.
What did she say the down payment was?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
What was that?
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
What about when she identifies him?!
At my house...!
Wasn't your fault.
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
Hold it...!
Bullshit!  Prove it.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Lizzy!
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
I suppose.
What are you doing this weekend?
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
Peter?
I... I like you.  A lot.
Waldos.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Yeah, Roz.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
Peter, you're bleeding.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
A bit melodramatic?but if you could prove it?that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
How much do you know about it?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Break it off!
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
What some brandy?
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
Let's blow, Chauncey.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Let me go! Let me go!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Easy, Animal! Easy!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Harry -- I'm blind!
What do those broads say?
That's what I wanna hear.
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Let me do it, Hoffy.
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Not yet.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
We've all done a poor job of it.
Why the south latrine?
Los, los. Dummkopf!
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Says me.
You heard that, Sefton?
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
You off your rocker?
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
Yeah?
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
That is my wife.
Is it all right if we smell it?
Data, are you all right?
Are any of them inhabited?
Is she still angry?
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
What?
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Data, this isn't the time.
Data, are you all right?
Left behind?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Oh
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Keep her together until I get back.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
You must think I'm quite the madman.
The royal...studs?
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Status!
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Will we get another ship?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Still no response, sir.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
David, I don't understand...
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
My readings indicate great instability.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
I don't understand.
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
The Genesis planet is gone.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
Yes, yes, Spock...
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!

David?... David!
Wait! Give me a chance --
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
But -- why?
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
What I have done, I had to do.
So!  Speak!
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
I still don't under --
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
David --
So are we, it looks like.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
Don't tell me you've got something.
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
But the child --
Well done, Commander.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
He's on a build up to detonation!
I don't mean to intrude.
It was just words.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
Well?
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Tactical!
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Genesis, what's that?
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot俫?s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
What's she doing here?
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Uh oh.
Spock!
In my quarters, Uhura.
And why not?
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
I did not think so.
Yes.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Indeterminate life signs.
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
<u>WHAT</u>?
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Time from my mark...
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
Stop engines.
Fire all phasers...!
All moorings are clear, Captain.
I do not understand the final question...
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
You sure this is such a bright idea?
Bones, stay here.
Now wait just a damn minute.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Hi... Busy?
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Fundoscopic examination --
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Can you isolate the wave?
Find it?
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
No choice now, Scotty!
Ah, well done, team 2.
"Neutralized?" How?
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What's that?
Wanna try it from the top?
I'm all ears.
... Gone?!
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
Where are you going?!
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
I meant --
Can we make breakaway speed!?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Systems report.  Communications?
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
Admiral! There be whales here!
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
The explosive override -- ?
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Father...?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
Will it?
A perfect moment?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Yes... that looks like them.
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
Incomplete, I might add.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
What kind of concerns?
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
Implants bothering you?
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
Who is it?
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
Worf, you must hurry...
Captain...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Scanners are off line!
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
You need a haircut, Commander.
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
... Population three hundred million...
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Why would we be involved with these people?
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Come in.  Hi.
All hands. Battle stations!
Initiate launch sequence.
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Are you saying they won't help us?
You think they're still up there?
Is it Japanese?
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Isn't it better like this...?
Can you configure it?
What year is it?
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
Where?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
ATR setting...
Where in the States?
What do you want?
There is no invasion...
Cochrane?
Did you need something?
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
What?
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
What the hell is happening, Worf?
What are they doing?
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Wil... Data was down there.
Worf to Bridge.
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Uh, Jim...
What the Hell's going on?
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
This is fun...
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
I was nervous -
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
They'll respect him now...
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
From Starfleet?
She's here - somewhere.
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Thank you, Captain.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
What took you so long?
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
How much time's left of your sentence?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Who is "US?"
Just the prototype.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
Me?
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
What is it?
Spock, I'm really tired...
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
The peace conference.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Trouble?
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
A computer canna lie, sir.
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Do you know who I am?
Do you know where you are?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
When was he... created?
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
To new worlds...
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
He is very observant.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Yes, sir.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
We are being hailed.
Why am I looking at me?
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. I抎 say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
Yes.
How can you be certain?
I'm only half human.
Imzadi. This is so good.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
You're not here.
No.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
With or without the rest of the fleet?
New Praetor?
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
I won't do it.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
We're being hailed.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Sir --
Why don't they answer our hails?
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
We need to talk, just you and I.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Not so long.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Are we prepared?
This is a mistake.
How long?
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
But surely...
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
Benny, God, take it easy...
What did I tell you?
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
What can I do for you folks?
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Make any money?
It's real, George.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
I just retired.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Please...
What?
What?
What?
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
No gas.
Who are you?
Gas.
No gas.
Who?
Shit.
No.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
What?
When do you have to be here?
No... The closest...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
What is hitchhike?
Say it.
The driver will...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
You want this ticket?
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Yes.
It's bad.
Do you have music up there?
You liked my singing?
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
You can have one.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
I don't want you to be hurt.
Where are you going?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Oh, you're pretty...
The cook again?
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
This is yours...
Where do you think you're going?
Well...
Tell the baby about me.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Is it for real?
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Where are you going?
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
Hello...
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
Faith, call me, okay?
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
You think Tran killed her?
No.
What kind of things exactly?
You were lucky, Max.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
Faith OK?
What stuff?
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
You just did.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
How did you hook up with Faith?
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Nero.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
That would be no.
Forget her.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
Is this great fabric or what?
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
No more, Lenny.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
What is it?
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Tell me.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
There's a plus side?
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Who's Strickland?
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
I guess.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Are we under arrest?
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Besides that.
Have you had a chance to think about --
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Anybody talk to the press?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
Agent Mackelway.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Hey, Sheriff.
Hi there.
I have 6 tons.
You... surprised me.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
My God.
What did he look like?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
I think I talked to him.
Speck. Harold Speck.
Its called insubordination.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
Why did you go to Chicago?
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
Don't you touch him.
Thanks for the ride.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
You work with Koessler?
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
What about the chat rooms themselves?
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
What's that?
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
And nobody else can do that?
Hello?
You were right. He found me.
You okay?
It's quite advanced.
All the same killer?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
Jaime --
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
Agent Mackelway?
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
Suspect Zero?
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
I've been to Chicago.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
I don't think you understand.
You have to put things in perspective.
Ever since I've known you.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Are you calling Her?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Hi.
How?
To do what?
Charles! What's up, man?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
...not until you book it...
They're out of Glenlivet.
You haven't told then, huh?
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
On the table.
Who's your booking agent?
It's a rebound.
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Me too.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...Which one...?
You want to hit the town tonight?
I'll give you an eight. 
Darwinism at its best.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Oh, like that song...
You want to talk about it?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
It's kinda money, actually.
Pause it. 
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
How's it going for you two?
She was cute.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Are you ready to order?
That's right.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
Hello?
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
VEGAS.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Cut that shit out.
That's not cool.
That's where we make our scene.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
What an asshole.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
...So give me the fuckin part...
She didn't like me, anyway.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
Don't remind me.
He drives a carriage.
I hear she's getting real fat.
No. Doesn't that suck?
Who? Rob?
What are you doing?
It's not like that...
...against the computer.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Oh, it's on, baby...
Yes she did.
...and you got big claws and fangs...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
You dick.
...Shut up, Sue...
It's on.
Sorry man.
The bear's got his claws back.
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Be my friend.
Godfather!
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
No.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
Is it necessary?
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
What is this nonsense?
But you needed a drink first.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
What was this for?
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
What is it?
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
Beautiful all over, eh?
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Mike!  The party starting!
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
We should hear what they have to say.
Jesus, I don't know...
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Mike, why am I out?
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
They're talking to themselves.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
Michael.
Michael, what are you doing?
Michael?
Michael...
I can't...
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Tell me!
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
Go on Mike.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
And all his works?
Do you wish to be baptized?
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
Is he alive?
How do you do.
We?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
You're breaking my ribs!
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Freddie?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
What are you talking about?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
Why?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
What?
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
I guess.
What about Christmas?
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Mr Greenleaf.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
What?
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
I told you. He gave them to me.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
What's your secret?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Let's go.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Dickie, my God!
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
My God.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
I've been backpacking.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
Tom, are you okay?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Was that Meredith?
Or Tom and Peter even.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
I really don't want to see anybody.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
Thank you.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
I have!
Well, we're all working tonight.
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
What are you doing?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Try holding the match like this.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
Stick up?
I have.
Well... I guess so.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Why? Who are you?
Do they drug you?
Where?
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Why?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
I sure hate to go alone...
You don't have to.
Have you tried the telephone?
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
No, I want long shifts.
No.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Who?
Anything you say, officer.
So howsit?
What's the action around?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Well, I just, you know...
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Not really.
It's me sir.
He's got a gun, sir.
I'll go.
God's speed.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
I believe you.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
Me too.
I do?
You first.
Do you have the...
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Nine hundred...
Well, there's got to be a way...
I see...
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Yes... yes, I do.
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
Are you saying that he's...
Mother o'god...
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
They couldn't wait to see you.
But I...
You bet.
Did I what?
A few.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
That's where you live.
Jesus.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Cigarette?
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
Sit.  Play with me.
Is there a young Tim?
That's my r-r-rent.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
What happened?
That you got let go.
Cathy?
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
San Francisco.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Then why did she object to you?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I see.
I did.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Do you think I should go?
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
Yes, I did.
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
What?
I wonder if you could help me.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
The little girl's name.
Are you sure?
Thank you.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
She was selling birds.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
They're gone. The same pattern.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
No.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Does this room look silly?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Doesn't what make me...?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Some of them are.
I don't know you.
What are you? A policeman?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
So you're a lawyer.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
What did it say?
With... with Annie, of course.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
And you didn't come up here to see her.
What did it say?
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
Some cream?
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
I think it's safe to get out now.
How long have they been gathering there?
When will they stop?
What time is it?
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
That... that... who was that?
Have you got a pencil?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
I haven't finished my drink.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
You must leave this house.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
But you did promise.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
Are you a doctor, too?
Hear him?
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
This is a gift.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
But why, Gray? Why?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
I hate that picture.
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
We won't.
Check and mate.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
The strip joint?
That was a fucking hollow point!
Think maybe knives do?
Fuck! What do you want?
You lied at my trial.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
What did they give you?
What did they give you?
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
How do you know?
Erin. It's not your fault.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
... it connects you to me...
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
You know.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Just don't believe everything you see.
Anything wrong?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
What is it?
What? What is it?
Sweetheart...
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Maybe a little demonstration.
Are you an FBI man?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
What does that mean?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
You must have come a long way.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
You know about the United Nations?
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
It was a wonderful day.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
I wonder if we ought to--
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
How do you know?
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
What happened?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Where are you going now?
Hello.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
No -- no, thanks.
But I suppose you know the answer.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
All day.
Well... we blew Plan A.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
They're looking at us.
Two down and two to go.
We were gonna grab some food.
What's going' on?
With him?
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
Oh, no...
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
... And stay outta here.
Good!
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
You like Michael.
See you later.
We are...
Ocean air!
Help me, Mom.  Help.
He met a girl.
Lights out, Sam.
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
You're cute, Max.
Does it burn?
I am?
I'm Michael.
I guess you're new around here.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
Why not?
Then it's not too late for us...
I know, I've felt it...
David's looking for me... I have to go.
Huh?
You're beautiful.
Go away.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Mom's home?...
I'm making you a sandwich.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Star.
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Maybe dinner.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
How you doin', old boy?
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
What?
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Let's open it.
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
What do we do about those three?
You ain't tying me up.
Not the only one.
Neither will we.
Anything?
Now hold him.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
After all this mess then.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Four!
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
What kind of test?
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
He might just wait us out.
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What about Childs?
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
You jerking off or just pissed?
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
Sir... have you a name?
But you escaped.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
Yes...
Why did they built it?
Vox --
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
And what of the Eloi?
So you take their best...
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
It's spectacular...
Dance with me...
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Alex, what is it?
Alex... people are staring.
Where's the challenge in that?
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
I've been working.
I know that --
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
How long did you travel?
His curiosity is amazing.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
How long ago?
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Yes.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Yes... I suppose so.
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Kalen...
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
I am the oldest.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
You ok?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
We're late.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
I think I can remember what's on them.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
I gave you my dog tags.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
[Beat] You bled to death.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
What?
I don't understand.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You were convicted of the crime.
Why, what would you do?
My God you look exactly like him.
How'd he get it?
You don't understand.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
The future doesn't look different?
And how do you know that?
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
I tried to kill my wife.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
It's gonna be sticky.
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
What's this?
You don't think that's crazy?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
You want anything special for dinner?
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
Who do you think did it?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
I've been better.
Hey.
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
Alright.
That's certainly possible.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Armed robber.
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
So how come you don't have any kids?
Did you get married real young?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
That sounds nice.
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
I always knew that.
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Do you love me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Whose place is this again?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
It means shut up, Thelma.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Call him?
Will I be?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Drive!  Drive away!
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
It won't work.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Before.
What little dogs?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
Sorry!
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
Louise?
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
You're a good friend.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
What in the hell is that up there?
What in the hell is it?!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
Then let's not get caught.
Go.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Hi!
Where you goin'?
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Whatever happened to Mary?
Why not?
What's so funny?
Mary's a babe!
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
No You mean...?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
You know, clean the pipes.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
So... I see you made the news.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Nineteen months I been sober.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Don't you want to know my name?
How'd you know that?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
So...
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Fuck!!
All set.
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Any idea where I might start looking?
I don't buy it.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
How many is that?
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
I see where you're going.
I don't watch the new ones.
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Pat does projects all over the world.
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
What's up?
I think you'd better sit down.
Oh, are you on the team?
Are you all right?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
How are you doing, Warren?
See you, Warren.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
I'll do it.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
What's happened?
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Hey, sport. You winning?
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Hey.
A murder. On the reservation.
What's this about?
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
Why does he wanna see me?
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
That's not solid.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
Cuz I'm a skin?
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
You take care.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
X22. Read.
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
No way. No fuckin' way.
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
You saw a MiG 21?
Yes, ma'am.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
Yes. I'll give you that!
I can't.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
I'm different.
That's true. What are you?
You're horrible
You ever think about killing another human being?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
Well no...inverse order.
This is it, then.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
Off me or off you?
One more.
Looks like a tie.
I know exactly what you mean.
I live here, remember?
Can't shake him.
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
What are you doing?
I know!
Gotta go, man.
Let me do the talking.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
So I've heard.
What was that?
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
I've lost him -- where is he?
It's a victory roll.
What the hell is this?
I'm pinned to the panel.
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
A plaque?
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
GET LOST!
Figured it out yet?
Need a hint?
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
Was going.  Now you are.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir..
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
I'll go encode your room key.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Bob?
I'm with an very important client.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
I'm listening.
Amazing.  Where are we?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
HER!
Pull them out.
Yeah.
I don't know.  Maybe.
Why not?
No shit...
What trip?
What are you, my father?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Shit!
I've got a lock!  There!
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
Would you please repeat the destination?
...You mean it?
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
--I got a trip to Mars.
I suppose you're not here either.
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
All right.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
I don't remember you.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Why would I lie to you?
Don't be ridiculous.
I thought you didn't like me.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
What can I do?
What reactor?!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
...Who are you?
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
How much you think?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
BACK OFF, BURT...!
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
I might have an idea...
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
You're full of shit.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Fuck you!
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
We'll take your word for it.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
You go north, I'll go south.
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Watch your ass, shithead.
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
What the hell are you doing?!!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Somebody paying you to do this?
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Down, honey, down.
The con...!  Oh my God.
Come on.  Get away from it!
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Think it's still following us?
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
How can you remember that?
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
You see that? You wanna be like that?
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
That DD-5.
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
I embellished.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
-- Find him?
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
Figures.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
I'd l-like to answer the question.
I see: He'd walk out next month.
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
No.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Look. Mister --
Five years.
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
What color hair will she have?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Congratulations. I heard about that.
HE'S GONE.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
Where is the ring?
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
He didn't suffer.
No.
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
What is it?
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Maybe I better start our homework.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
But I love you, Laura.
Why do you do it, Laura?
Nice night.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
The pages are gone. That's real.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
Right on time, baby.
We're on our way, Baby.
Laura, do you love me?
We were supposed to be together.
What's going on?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What do you mean?
Bobby killed a guy.
You want to see...
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
I hate asparagus.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
When's the next business trip, big fella?
What are you doing?
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
...tell me about this case.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
You know what that would mean?
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
I do. Yes.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
How is that?
I did.
Objection!
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Mr. Concannon...?
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
It's all right, Mickey.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I am on the staff of...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
I'm sorry...?
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Thank you...
Thank you.
Mrs. Simmonds.
One hour.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Are you done?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What are you going to do?
Continental Casualty...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Mr. Galvin's...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
You know what happened.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Another, Frank...?
...now who is that...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
...he's a good man...
Who have we got?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
...Gruber's not bad.
So what?
Today is Tuesday. What?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
That's right.
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
She told me.
I just saw her.
Dr. Towler...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
There's nobody left around here now.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
Is that... machine...?
Where are we?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
Nothing there now.
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
You mean that was a...
One of mom's cups got broken.
No, you don't.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
These look quite fresh.
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
Time for sleep.
Who?
He's on his way.
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
Do you have to die to see God?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
What...happened?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
You didn't jump in.
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
I know how Chase really died.
I want to see the body.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Captured?  How?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
That was Nancy, not me!
No, not really.  I...
Can I get you something to drink?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
You sound so sure.
You may not like what you hear.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Albatross?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Hey, shut up will ya?
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
Why'd you do it?
Is it true Phil?
How ya doing?
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
My parents don't do it anymore.
It was so real...
Uh, huh.
Can't do it.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Stow away?
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Spying?!
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
What?!  What's happening?!!
And being sixteen.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
What?  Come on...
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
Tie it off!!
What do you think?
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
About yourself?
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
I'm not gonna kill it.
What are you blubbering about?
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
No.
I can't be sure.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Easy for you to say.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
I'm from all over.
How 'bout a beer?
No.
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
You heard from Reggie?
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
No shit?!?! You know him?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
So, it's back to the islands.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
Hasta siempre.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
What?
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
You won't of missed much.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
What's that honey?
Sailor?
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
...are followin' him around.
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
They sure do stink.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
What's that, honey?
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
What's that, peanut?
Huh?
You got me, peanut.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
That you, Sail, honey?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
Mama???
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Six.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Oh God! What does that mean?
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
What do you want me to do about it?
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Where we goin'?
What?...
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
I know... I remember.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
Tripp!
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Trip??
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
So. Is he any good?
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Not Curtis.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Shut up, James.
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
So -- what do we do now?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
You driving this car?
She told you about...
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
Sure.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
You cold, James?
So what are you doing out here?
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
They're glass. The buttons.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
Can I ask you something about her?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
Isn't this...?
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
You're lying.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
But, last night...
You coming?
It's because you don't eat.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
I'm not going with them.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Near Carvel?
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
New?
Is that Cristaile?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Pow.
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Oh?
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
And what do you think you might have said?
And what did you say?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Did you just make that up?
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
I need a ride.
He's writing his name in water.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
Oh?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
Are you riding with me, James?
There's so many...
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Foreman now.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
Then what? What?!
What's happening?
Fucking Mariners.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
I'd love to hear it.
Don't you have friends?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Hiya, Walter.
What's up?
Doesn't everybody?
Okay?
Too much sun.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
Do you believe in them?
You knew her?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
I wasn't feeling well.
What's with the boxes?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
Are you taking your medication?
I'd keep away from him.
Banished... yeah.
No thank you.
No.
You seem a little hostile today.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
How do you define it?
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
That's not a helpful answer.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Where are you?
But roughly, how old?
What else?
You felt pleasure.
Did you get an erection?
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
What?
Very weird.
What's weird about that?
You never spoke to me before.
Are you?
They could eat you.
No you're not.
I thought I'd stay the night.
Hey, there.
Why do you want to know?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Depraved? My mistake.
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
You mean the time you're locked away?
I'm sorry, Walter.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
They seduce you?
And what do you tell yourself now?
Most people say the odds are against me.
I got poked around... here and there.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
I've got problems.
What's going on?
You okay?
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
I think you were worried about me.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
I haven't worn mine in months.
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
Need some help?
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
No, Bud, no... not you.
Hello, Brigman.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
You better not say you missed that.
Y'all could be more specific.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
Getting a reading?
4800 feet.  It's official.
Would we see the flash?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
Claudia, aren't you coming?
And how long will you be away?
Used to what?
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Find anything?
Nothing... nothing at all!
Are you feeling better?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Yes, you should go.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Claudia, listen to me...
Any news?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
No, Sandro... Please...
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
Have you ever been in love?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Who are you talking to?
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
I'll stay here also.
And what are we going to do now?
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Don't you ever paint men?
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
And how come you're up so early?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Why?
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Why?
What do you mean?
For what?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Where do you meet?
I got sicker.
Yes.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
What's your real name?
Do you have any children?
Why do you smoke?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Why not?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
How?
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
And that you're stupid?
That you're a mistake?
Oh, yes.
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
Who am I?
I'm frightened.
Why?
Why were you afraid?
Will she be angry?
And then what happened?
My bed.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Of what?
Do you remember what just happened?
Agnes, can you hear me?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
No...
Not your fault...
I hate him.
Look into the convent records.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Something they... that they overlooked.
Thanks. 
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
Who was the father?
What man had access to her?
I believe Agnes is different.
That's absurd!
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
You hate us don't you?
She is not a child.
???  
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
I am...
Oh, Dear God...
The sheets...
Your niece!
Listening to angels?
Her spiritual health.
Would you like one?  Huh?
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Fine thanks...
Even Christ would partake socially.
She's been touched by God, yes.
The father!
Don't be ridiculous.
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
But how did it happen?
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
Hasn't she had enough?
Was it you?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
For what?  An abortion?
You wanted that child out of the way.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
She can't remember.
Of course, John.
Lay them down.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Well --
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Yeah.
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
You don't think...
Leave them drums alone.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Are you going in?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Get him out of here!!
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Sure. .
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Should I say it?
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Sorry.
Oh!
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Gear?
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
But that's not like a real person at all.
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Parading's better!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
You're only right.
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Is that yours?
What are you doing there?
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
What's old got to do with it?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Now get on with it.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
Hi Norm!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
How's that?
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
I'll set John on you!
What is he?
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Oh... God... am I cold...
Locked.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Are you in pain?
Where's Irth?
Can you get it a little closer?
What is it?
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Can we come up?
Breathe deeply.
I have recorded the transmission.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Dead!
What the hell's going on?
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
Where did it come from?
It makes me sick to see him like that.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
Can you get them back?
What do you mean, no?
Recognizable!  In that?
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
First contact...
What's the frequency?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
That sounds a little fanciful...
How?
And what do we do when we find it?
I thought I'd find you here.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Let's hear it.
Oh my God.
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Martin?
Find anything we missed?
Still worried?
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
Take us up.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
Where are you?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Two down, four to go.
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Are you alright?
I found it...
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
It's too late!
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
How much air-time have I got?
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
One of 'em must have escaped.
Whoa, wait a minute...
What the hell are you doing?
Is this the suit?
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
That's what we thought.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Okay, I'm out of here!
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Seltzer?
I've found Ackland!
Think I spoke too soon...
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
How do you know my name?
And what is your name?
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
You take charge.
Hungry?
I don't think that's funny.
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
That's not true!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
Then say so.
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
No, it's not.  It's for this.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Let's go sit by the piano.
I was there. An eyewitness.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
Didn't you know?
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Right here. A minute ago.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Knit me a muffler.
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
She did...?
Yeah... I will.
Okay.
I'll check with Eve...
It's a good thought.
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Addison-!
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Well, I am.
Don't be condescending.
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Every day.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
- and for you.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
She works hard.
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
I think she would cheer.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
Well... it started with the play before this one...
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
She's just outside the door.
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
How far to the station?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
How about calling it a night?
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
I'm sure.
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
That's right, but I don't understand-
Play it again.
"Liebestraum."
Are you breaking the contract?
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
Carl?
All right, what do we know?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
Were you eyebrow reading?
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
Did he just say what I think he said?
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Morning or night?
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
Sure--off the record.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--no--
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Five hundred; six maybe.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
FBI too?
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
No games, Irwin; give.
Something maybe big.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
--I'm not your source on that--
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
--I'm sure--
We can't talk inside either?
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
Are you implying you don't believe me?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
Go on.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
What?
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Your name, please.
Where in government?
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
Good work, Ostreicher.
Great evening, isn't it?
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
This is your plan, Finch?
Just go!
You're gonna shit your pants!
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Not bad, Chris.
Um...Chris --
What's your middle name?
Come on!  I won't tell.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
That's not why we're going out.
I think I've had one.
No you haven't.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Give it to me!  Yes!
Don't you love my sexy body?!
Fuck me!  Yes!
You think she was serious?
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Did I miss anything?!
Holy shit.
Hey, minuteman.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
I know, Dad.
Whatever you want.
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
I still think you're okay.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
About the other day...I've been thinking.
Now?!
Yeah Vick?
Victoria...I love you.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Kevin, it was just a --
...Guess what?
NOVA!!
That junior chick?
Bullshit.  From where?
Really?
Merde! Just missed!
The key is don't look down.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Serafine...
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Are you crazy!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Holy mother of God...
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
What does it say?
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Before the coma!
Claude...?
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Nothing's happening!
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Where is it! Please!
Jesus...
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
What did she say?
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
What were you showing her?
Where is your home, Anya?
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Who did you hear it from?
Did I tell you that?
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
You never thought of the possibility?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
By pulling my hair?!
Come on up!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Who are you, child?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Dmitri didn't want the money?
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
I'm getting a chest cold..
It's her.
What do we do now?
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Yes.
Allison.
We've been through this.
Lyndon Johnson?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Oh!
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Well, then, w-who was?
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Oh, right.
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
I'll see yuh.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Uh, narcolepsy.
God bless.
Yeah.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay?
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
No.  You're a wreck.
Here, you want some?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Don't you think I do?
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
How is it any different?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Uh-uh-why?
Oh, you have my body.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
You're so sure about it.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
You followed me!
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Yeah, where is the spider?
Is he in the bathroom?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
That's sick!
God.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Yeah, this place is great.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
You look very pretty.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
Oh!
This is my room.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Oh, you got a headache!
I mean that as a compliment.
Probably on their first date, right?
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Yes.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Mean?
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
Stop calling me Max.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
What's the matter?
Well, sit down.
You all right?
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
You fired the cleaning woman?
They're persecuted enough!
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Well, hi!
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
There were many men interested in you?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
What's that?
Isn't Skye amazing?
Honey?
Why didn't you bring him?
Why didn't you bring him?
I'll change back before we leave.
Would you leave us alone right now?
It's not a contest.
Take good care of it.
Can I open it?
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Oh yeah...
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
You only made half your quote this year.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Yes.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
No.  Did you?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Otis!  No barking!
Still champions.
About me!
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Has she called?
Yes, she is.
Don't I find what?
And I you.
The infamous dog?
Ours.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Sally did all this herself?
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
A little out of my element.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Scout's honor.
Ryan's really angry with me.
Medallions.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Are you making an ass of yourself?
Ready to go?
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
What?
I so wish I'd known.
Come on in.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Will champagne help?
Okay.
Shit!
So how are you really doing, Panes?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Well, something's wrong.
Thank you, Panes.
I didn't know you had this.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
He's a novelist.
She's such a great photographer.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
I trust you.
Well good.  Thank God.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
I don't have a drug problem.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
Tell me about it.
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
And you are...?
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Worker!  Come back here now!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
So what makes you so special?
Come on, Z.
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Who is that idiot?
You new, kid?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Barbatus!
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
May I cut in?
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
...I should?
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
Not there.  Under the mat.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Marry Christmas.
What gave you that idea?
One more?
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
Your phone.
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Who?
And where are you now?
Something wrong with your legs?
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
We're going to finish that gin game.
How's everything at the apartment?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Oh.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
The Vice Squad?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
I'm not through with you yet.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
You know how people talk.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
You like?  It's all yours.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
What are you going to do, Doc?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
What's her name?
What's this -- you packing?
That so.
Who is Mickey?
Family?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
No kidding.
And what happened to you?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Please -- just let me sleep.
Yes, I know.
Will you excuse me?
That's right.
I don't believe you.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
No -- absolutely not --
Two whole drums --
We've been attacked.
How about a drink ?
How?
What do you see?
I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
And the grass?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
Can I go get those mangos now?
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
I --
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Listen.
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
You didn't like him.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
What -- happened here.
No, sir.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
They far enough?
The wind --
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
What do you mean?
Can you trust them?
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
Do you?
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
Gimme water.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
Did you know him very well?
And you admired him?
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
What's that?
Are you finished surfing?
No -- no, Captain.
What's this tiger shit?
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Yes.
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --

Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
Stay here.
Thanks.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Be careful, okay?
Where's Corbett?
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
I already have.
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
I'm too old for this shit.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
He saw you and Corbett come in...
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
...Ben never sent a signal.
There's what they're waiting on!
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
How long has he been having problems?
Have they done blood tests on him?
I know. He's just the best.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
Uh, Udall?
Why did yo do this for me?
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
What needs clearing up?
So. Anything else?
Lovely.
I can't. I work.
My son.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
I was going to do that for you.
You wanna dance?
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Sex with Simon?
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't want to hear that music right now.
The two might go together.
Cute.
Grouchy?
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Uh-huh...
Good night.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
But what about...
Help!
You changed the room around...
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Sure thing.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
I brought you Chinese soup.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
That's very thoughtful.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
Picking on me won't help.
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Uh, Fontella's
Where you from?
Probably.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
What are you doing?
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
What?
Who is the mark?
Hello, Robert.
I know what happened.
A player?
Twenty large?  That's all?
He wants to kill you?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Women?  No... not really.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
My first take?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
Do you have a passport?
You should knock.
Two way?
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
What?
I told you, he will.
I don't believe that.
Ten years ago.
Ten years later, here you are again.
I think I got one today.
They're worth less points.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
Because, I'll take it.
Yes.
Attraction is a complication?
It happened to you before?
What happened to her?
Did you --
Four minutes.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
I'm taking off my mike.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
I wasn't watching television.
Why are you working today?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
Thank you.
Right.
What are you thinking about?
You wish to close this account today?
This will take some time.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
Cheers Katka!
So how's your work?
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
How to make a buck!
Because it's in English?
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Destroy the evidence huh.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Now you're using that word.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
I can't go with him.
You don't understand, I can't!
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Good morning.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
She's tired.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
No, I love you, really.
Yeah, for sure.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
Okay?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
And take Jiri with you?
Will this thing take long?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Better than you.
What is it you want?
I'm not sure it's possible.
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
So, he didn't fire you?
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
You are quite sure it's secure?
And what of these foreigners?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
She asleep?
Why not?
It could help with a new car --
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
A late night or an early morning?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
I'm thinking.
Don't call him a dipshit.
The address?!
Deranged.
I'm very sorry --
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
So what else is on this list?
Like you'd know.
No problem --
What is that?
Saturn. Beautiful.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Oh. Just not at school...
Maybe you inspire me.
Like fire.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Your turn.
What do you actually know with religion?
I don't understand...
You make me feel...
Ergo?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
Nope.
How're you doing?
I'll talk to your father.
But if you could, you would?
So talk to us about something.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Materially or spiritually?
Landon. You go on home.
You have materials for the side bearings?
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
For Jefferson High. For books.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
What's N.R.C.?
How was school today?
It's polyester.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Then you'll be going to school here....?
What time does school start around here?
By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
The sunrise? What for?
What do I say?
'Bike fine point?'
You mean, you're gonna --
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
What, am I radioactive or something?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
A gold mine?
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
There's no way of knowing.
You didn't?
What year is this?
Obviously!  
What did you do to your hair?
I'll catch up with you.
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
You ever held another job before?
Good luck to you.
Okay.
Jack.
You still in school?
My stomach's growling.
Somebody else is going to get it.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Is that all there is to it?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
Yes.
I'd like to get out of here.
Everybody loves trout.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Have you got a better idea?
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
What's that?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Fine.
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
You're a welcome sight...
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
Did you say..."Peggy"?
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
Another 'you'?
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
Oh, my.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
So where's Buckaroo?
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I see.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his ?
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Barton!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
No, I ?I didn't mean to sound ?
Ever talk to him?
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the ?
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
I don't understand-
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
...That's fine.
...Barton, is everything okay?
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying ?a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
...What's the expression ?me myself and I.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration ?
I hope these are your shoes.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Yeah, but ?
...Your room does that too?
So they say.
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Jesus... You're leaving.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help ?
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
...Okay
L.A.P.D.
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Big fuckin' deal.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
He teach you to do it?
Yes, Colonel.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
So -- how are things?
Yes.
What was she like?
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
What is this interest you've got in her?
I thought you hardly know her.
She told you, didn't she?
I had him in two classes.
You should do something about this lock.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
Did you leave the club with him?
Yes, you do.
You like playing games, don't you?
Sure.
I passed.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
How's your shoulder?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
You won't believe me.
About three months before I met you.
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
Did you ever tie him up?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
You feeling better?
Catherine says you don't like her.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
You sure?
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
You knew her, didn't you?
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
How old was she when this happened?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
Of what?
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
What's with the wigs?
Piss painting?
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
Who did this?  Who did this?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
What are they?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
A primate?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
I use a lot of colors ?not only black.
I'm not black.
Not what?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called ?hmmm...  ?yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Hey ?Willie Mays.
Your people.
You gonna carry that around all night?
She's good.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
You do! You definitely do.
You're back.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
... babies.
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're ?
Hi.
See you later.
That's a beautiful name. French?
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts ?you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
That one's for you.
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother ?when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
You don't have any!!!
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Didn't I say that?
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Pouring myself into my work.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
... What do we do?
No.  No glass on the inside.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
You have?
Is there something wrong, sir?
But I can't can I?
It's good to see you.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
No sign of the snowman.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
And?
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
The dreams again, sir?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
And another name for Mystery?
What now sir?
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Now black rubber.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
Rinka.
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
What do you know about obsession?
To kill me.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
That kid is amazing.
Touchy, touchy.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
Okay. I'm outta here.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
You can't-.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
No.  Wait...
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
A-14.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
GET IN THE CAR!!
Look! Police!
...Not even a 'thank you'?
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
Do you want a drink?
What did you see?
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
Got it!
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
Joker here. Can we talk?
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Yum, yum.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
You are on drugs.
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
There were three strawberries.
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
shhh...
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
What happened?!!!
Oh yes.
Howls he getting on with the family?
Everything okay, David?
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
Of course.
Welsh again.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
Well, there is that ...
Come on Sting!
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Me first.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Damn, huh huh.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
That's not that much.
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Um... ass... head...
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Cavity search...?
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Chief, look!
Do her? Huh huh.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Anything happen while I was away?
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
I guess we open it.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
And your sushi was remarkable.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
Aren't you scared?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
How'd you do on the science test?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Beetle!
So... You're ready for me now?
Can you help <u>me</u>?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
Okay?
<u>Oh my God</u>!
You don't have a key?
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
You were wrong, it did hurt.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
... And please call me Robert.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
... Do you think we should look for him?
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
Oh. I have a message for him.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
I hope you're comfortable.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
What is that?
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
... Are you sure you like it?
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
I feel very good in here.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Well, that's good news, my boy.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
What about money?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
Please, sir.
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Since you were a child?
How were you paid?
1952...?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Good morning, Mr. President.
... In the garden?
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
No headaches?
You heard?
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
And look who you brought with!
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... Would you take me on a tour?
... Yeah...
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
... So what does all that add up to?
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
I don't know.
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Enjoy.
Which one is Elijah again?
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Did you eat?
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
How was it?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I need a shower.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
I know.
Holy shit, yes!
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
So how was it?
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Money, Miss Warts?
Yex?
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Is that true?
Emily Dickinson.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Yeah.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Hi.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
You're glowing again.
Let him try.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
Vegas? What'd you think?
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Forget it.
Thank you, Floris.
Says me. Do you dream often?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Oh, be still my heart.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
How do we do that?
Never heard of it.
Is there dancing?
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Darling!
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Vegas.
Yeah what?!
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You still know.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
YOU HURT ME.
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
You on your way home?
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
Yes?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Be here. In case.
Won't you be late for work?
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
MAMA!
No...no...no..
Can't locate him.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
What run him off? Tell me that!
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Jesus.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Her life is in your hands.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
Jesus fucking Christ.
What's this?
What the fuck is he talking about?
What do you mean, Dude?
Sheesh.
What tied the room together, Dude?
He peed on the Dude's rug--
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
It's already posted.
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Are you gonna split hairs?
Am I wrong?
What do you need that for, Dude?
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Please, feel free to inspect them.
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
No, they--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Ahh, not so good, man.
Which one was Logjammin'?
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Oh yeah?
I was talking about my rug.
Oh, no.
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Shit yeah, the achievers.
Well--sure, I could do that--
Yeah, but what about--
That's really thoughtful but I--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
From who?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
This was, uh--
What the fuck are you--
No, but--
Theodore Herzel.
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
The what?
What the hell is this?
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
That wasn't her toe.
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
No.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Oh, shit.
Call the medics, Dude.
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Employed?
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Yeah, but--
Walter--
<i>You'll</i> take him.
What?
Why?
You're hurt.
What about Nomak?
Recognize him?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
You don't want to go there.
It means "bloodbrother."
What do you want me to do?
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
What's your problem, Whistler?
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Going on twenty years now.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
Don't try to talk --
You're not going anywhere.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
You used me as bait?!
But, he could've --
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
You don't look so good.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
How long have we been driving?
Get out of here --
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
But you -- died --
How could you be a part of this?
This isn't human blood.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
What happens then?
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
But you use blood banks --
What -- ?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
Whistler!
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Why?
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
--how old?
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
--now c'mon!
Just now?
I want to see something!
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
You want a hand?
Beer and weed is what I've got.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I don't think it was them.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
The witch?
Nice tent.
Never would've guessed.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Get <u>out</u> of here!
--yeah, a hand or something--
Me, too.
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Mi casa y su casa!
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
Be it still alive, James?
That's a "j."
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
<u>What</u>?
How're the cameras doing?
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Just let it go, I've got you!
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Why?
She got <u>paid</u>.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
What?
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
What?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Jesus.
You gonna be alright?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
Finally got her back to sleep.
Heather.
Okay. Hypothetically.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
I can't do it!
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
"It's why the witch kills children."
What the fuck's going on here?
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
....Ma'am?
Your mother's pastor.
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
...Drive me to a motel?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
...What's going on with you two?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
...So what're you doing tonight?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Well now you do.
What's the matter?
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
...What?
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
...Count it if you want.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Got a problem, Meurice?
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
Come into the study a minute.
Jeffrey?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
What is this? What color is it?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Hello, baby.
Who's this fuck?
Yes, but.
Can I feel 'em?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Don?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
I made it go down the toilet.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Yes. Frank-
I want you to hurt me.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I'm glad you do.
Dorothy. no!
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Heineken.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
What happened to him?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
You really want to do this, don't you?
What's the plan.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
What's with Mike?
You want a Dairy Queen?
Twice. without her sensing anything?
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
Shoot.
Everything okay?
You want to dance?
... Sandy?.
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
What time are visiting hours?
Well. Okay.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Can I use the car tonight?
Well.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
He comes over to study.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Come on out a minute, okay?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
No honey, I'm alright.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Blanca, por favor.
Honey, your nose!
You wanna split?
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Tuna, this is crap.
Tuna, this is crap.
Excuse me?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
What the fuck is that?
I don't think so.
What did I tell you?
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
No, my brother.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
I know.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
Surprised to see me?
G-d, son.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Layaway shmayaway.
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
Freedom.
Keep them coming.
George, you look terrible.
Diego?
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
Just low.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Hi.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
Give this to Mom, will you?
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Alright.
Where are you going?
Hey, George.  You okay?
Yeah.
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
I swear.  On my life.
I fucked up.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Stoned?
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
Second name.
Which "district" do you belong to?
What's happened to you?
With an unloaded pistol?
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
It's good nobody is following us ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
No, and neither were my men.
To show them to the UN, right?
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
About three hours.
That's what my report will read.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Then how did it get into his body?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
What did they argue about?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Can I go?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
How did he look?
Is it Marsh?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
Did you suggest any?
What did she say?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
October twenty-seventh.
No.
Where did you meet him?
Then what happened?
How do you know that?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
No.
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Yes -- it would be nice.
You and me -- making love.
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Alone?
Something wrong?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
I'm dropping the case.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
No -- he's lying.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Michael -- get off the phone.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
But Your Honor--
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
She sounds like quite a woman.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
I don't know.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
It had to get there somehow.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Grateful!?
What are you doing?
Well, I'd like to read them.
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Not this kind of heat.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Pretty country.
Oh. When did you move back?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Oh, that's nice.
Lemon?
And how long are you here for?
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Is the dizziness gone?
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
You sound like an artist.
And did you?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
Woman friends, too?
Why doesn't it scare you?
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Why do you say that?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
I can't do this, honey.
You're somewhere else, where?
Am I too heavy for you?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
What are you doing?
How do you know what I experience?
Stop it!
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
No. Don't do this.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
'Bout 4:30.
What time is it?
Where you going?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Oh my God...!
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Died there?  How?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
You think that's really him?
You soundin' like the old man now.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
You got a nice crib here.
What else?  Money.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
I said, no thanks.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
I want you to do something for me, baby.
Where are we, baby?
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
What it will be.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Aren't you going to join us?
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
Please.  It's for your own good.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
We just thought...
That's all we did, steal their ride.
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
Jimmy Bones?
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
Admit what?
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
Where is it?
Caesar?  What is this?
Sit down, Gino!
I didn't expect --
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
They just left, didn't they?
That doesn't make any sense.
What?
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
He didn't see you, did he?
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
...  maybe three hours.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
It's not here, Caesar.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Where is the money?
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
What?
But everybody is all right.
You're helping Rajeev?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Okay, sure, Mick.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
Who?
Do you know him?
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
I'm glad you did.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
What time did you say they would be there?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
What if he sees you?
I'm just asking, what if?
I had a partner and she fucked me.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
okay, all right.
I was so afraid you ...
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
-- he went inside! --
We don't know what we're into!
What do they want me to do?
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
I don't know.
So now you know.
That's all I get?
Keep it. 
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Sir, you waited on line.
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
I need a ride.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
You ever think maybe you have a family?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
-- just --
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
What is that?

You have ID?
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You telephone, sir.
... fix themselves.
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Help me!
Long time no see!
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Layton! Oh shit!
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
What's she done?
Er ... no.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Out of kindness.
They weren't at school with us.
It could all be coincidental.
Stamped?
You think these are tits don't you?
It does doesn't it?
No, really.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Please, Jill ... I love you.
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
What do you think? ... is it me?
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Sod it, it's broken!
Mother? Is that you?
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
Sam!!! 
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
I mean it fixed itself.
Now look what you've done to him.
What?
For God's sake, what's happened?
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
I've never fired anyone in my life.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Does that hurt?
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
He's dead, huh?
Did you see my father?
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Not as good as Nino's.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
I'm sorry.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
Mr. Oh.
Let's get in a fight, then.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Turn it off.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
They'll just keep calling.
Well why didn't you say so?
Wait.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
London.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eventually rising to...
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Yes.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
Do you feel good about it?
Don't go.
I think you're the Devil.
So who's the guy?
Ready.
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
The cost-efficient reporter.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Just when do you start, telling people?
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
It's Aaron.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
Because...
I wish it were you giving the story.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
You don't have to finish tonight.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
One year...almost one year.
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Hi.
So he was indicted?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
I'll wait for you till seven.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Yes.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
At least kiss me when you do that.
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
What?
Hi.  It's me.
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
You're saying stay away from him.
Where's the bathroom?
Are you okay?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
Look at the size of it!
Let's see it.
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
Hi Walter.
Did you hear what he said?
I mean, you look so pretty.
I like you very much, Walter.
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Here you go, enjoy.
It was.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
Now what kind of statue was that?
There's that weird dude again.
Man look at that get up !
What did he say?
People seem to like my cat.
H-have a seat?
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
A show..how soon can we go?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
Police officer.
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
What's wrong with you!?!
Man has a complex.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
It's coffee.
Figures.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Dying.
You okay?
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
You left me a message?
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
How are you doing?
You want some water or something?
Hey, Buffy...
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
You look way pretty, Kim.
What are you talking about?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Wait a minute.
Where's the other one?
Meet me at this address after school.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, him.
Not a pressing issue.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Sporting events, yeah.
Who we gonna beat?
But you threw a knife at my head!
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Interesting.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
All right.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
So very much.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
I can't!
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
You think so?
Write that down.
Omniplex?
Cool!
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
The right nostril.  Good.
How was that?
Fundamentals?
I knew it--you're seducing me!
I'd like you to meet my father.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
I don't dance.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Why not?
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
What's that?
Will that work for me?
I got him on the knee!
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was playing naked.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Nuke--  Good luck.
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
Take the first shot at me.
Who you calling a "boy"?
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
Little high.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
It's a miracle.
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
Ain't here.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
Hi, Ace.
That's right.
You were wandering around.
A powerful man.
You got it.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
...stupid things.
No, you're not calm.
Stop -
Okay.
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
No, of course not.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
All right, Ace?
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
In other words, I'm fucked.
Hey, Ace.
You think he got the point?
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
All right.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
How'd you know I was here?
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
You've got to stop her.
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
...and she doesn't always -
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Now, he's really pissed.
Okay, thank you for asking.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
You all right?
You're with me now.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
Why do you need that much?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
You didn't have to beat him up!
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
How serious?
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
Why do you want to do that?
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
Oh, sh-
Fuck you.
I want you to let me go.
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
I am not!
Don't you threaten me!
...and hypocrisy.
It won't happen again, Sam.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
You gotta go back out there.
Yeah, that works out.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
You just - Just stop him.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
Artie! Artie!
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Are you sure?
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Ace.
Hi, how are you?
Tell me.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
Thank you.
Yeah.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
No, he's not.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Yeah.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
Come on.
Do you know that?
He's sittin' by the phone -
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
They checked in alone.
Yes, don't worry.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
There's more!
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Ace saw Vegas one way.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
Mm.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Don't know.
I'm positive.
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
Again!
I know, but that's enough.
I know it, I know it.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Yes, uh...
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Have we reached the epi-center?
You know, nobody likes you...
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
I've been looking for you.
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Pass!
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
You like them, don't you, Boss.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Hey, you're anti-male.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Next time, call...
You turned around!
Like you don't know...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Okay, deal.
You're late.
Maybe.
Don't sneak up on me...
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
Was someone in an accident?
Who's on the phone?
Are you guys all right?
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Let's have your license, mister.
Lady, don't let him do it!
How do we get back to the freeway?
You never miss a trick.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Lady, try making some sense.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
I don't want to know --
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
I'm with two friends now.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Does she wear glasses?
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
What bank?
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Why tell me this?
You can't give up.
Yes?  Yes?
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
What did you do?
Rachel -- Oh my God.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
Damned if I know.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Who's in back?
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
What's that supposed to me?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Did you hear that?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Twenty percent.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
Pass.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Who's this?
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Can I make a quick call?
You could always make it up to her.
See that, Col?
Just cut his hair, you know.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Jimmy.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
And what's it like?
What was that?
You want me to ask you in, right?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Give me that look again.
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
What'll it be?
No.
You want to know how I kissed him?
But you can t stay, you know that?
I didn't mean to hit you.
Details, baby, details.
Don't.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Don't.
Come on.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
You do something for me, Dil?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
I had to go to work!
So tell me.
You heard what I said, Dil?
What pills?
Your soldier.
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
You killed my Jody?
You didn't.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
Love me.
What's Fergus?
She was --
You've got to go now, Dil --
Not if you go.
Meet Col --
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Tough work, that.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Of course. I forgot.
And what if I say no?
You were made for this.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Who's the old geezer?
You a handyman, Fergie?
Back in a minute, Jody
Why?
What?
Why do you want to do that for?
So it was you all the time.
He's at home.
And what's she like between the sheets?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
I seen your fucking face.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
What's that?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
They won't let him die.
What do you know about my nature?
Didn't look like that to me...
You make a nice couple.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
So what's that supposed to mean?
See? I was right about you.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
The best.
Is it bad?
I didn't.
What?
Don't think that way.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Don't.
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
The teddy bear?
What if I did?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
What are you talking about?
I could eat a horse.
Oh!
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Yes, you told me.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- 蒷ys閑s! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Carson?
Steal it how?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
Yes -- ?
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
No.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Bartholomew?
What's your first name today?
But you're -- divorced?
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
What now?
Sorry about that.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Your --
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Scobie?
You can't.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Got you.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Are you going to listen?
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
He was American?
He was a wealthy man?
Where did he keep his money?
Is it all right?
Oh, la.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Hallo, Peter.
I wasn't --
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
So they think he left it with you.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Yes -- that's right.
What'd he say?
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
I think it's funny.
is there anything you do?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
What do you mean?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Ok.
You were eavesdropping.
What did you hear?
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
Should we close down any eruption?
Well?
She's not here.
Of what?
She was murdered?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
No.
We just found another body.
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
Me? Why me?
_ Your father raped someone?
Mark Shale.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
No! That's his table.
Oh nice save.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Don't you think it's sick?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
I heard you got attacked.
Are you coming to the party?
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
My dad's down there!
I need to ask you something.
Lisa Sherman?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
Where are you going?
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
You can have both if you want.
Hide your laptop here.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
That wasn't me ...
At least somebody likes this shit.

Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Since when does...
...moron.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
What did I say?
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
I got, uh....
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
It happens to this piece of shit...
No cell.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
Ah, one of them's in the back.

Take your gun!
Okay!  All right!
You wanna hit me?
...I believe in live and...
I did not steal the truck.
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Come on, old Pete.
Get over!  Get over!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
What the fuck was that?!
Shut up!
Hang on!
 Listen!  Listen...
He's crazy!
...here!
Uh-oh.
Okay.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
...truck.
How wonderful for you.
Not completely, anyway.
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.

Hey, hey, hey.
Put your hand in my pants.
Arlo!  Arlo.
Arlo!
Oh, shit.
We!
...tunnel!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
What the hell?
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
They'll meet you at the top.
 Well.
Who put the big hurt on...
You, Arlo.
You.
Patriotism is its own reward.
No.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
We're worried...
I urge you to be persuasive.
But...
Well, that just about figures for today.
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
What?  Say again...
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
They were all wearing hardware.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
All right.  After they put you away...
Good to see you again, Leo.
I can't say it's a surprise.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
...comes up that road.

All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
There.
It's clean.
Dennis!
I wanna patch in from...
I'm on it.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Right.  Tim Mason.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
Is this your establishment?
....-lene.
Assumptions are always...
I beg your pardon?
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...

...should be right outside.
I want you to look at one another...
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
I don't see my container.
...-tainer!
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
Rangers.
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
That little geek is my...
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
My secret?
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...fishin'.

Well, your prediction was on the nose.
Lying? 
...beer.
...any idea what's goin' on here?!


Arlo.
Oh.
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
I'll stay here and secure this position.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
Then these are all new owners?
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Lou Escobar ?he's a Lieutenant.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
What for?
What about her?
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
What does this mean?
How do you do that?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
What's that, Curly?
They don't kill a guy for that.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Sure thing.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
That's a filthy habit.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
You've done well by yourself.
Congratulations.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
No. It was an accident.
Isn't that your number?
Absolutely.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
It's too late.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
No.
Not that Mulwray?
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
My husband.
Mr. Gittes.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Another satisfied client?
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Over the water department, or over you?
That dam is a con job.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Working for the District Attorney.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Hold still. Why?
Where are you going?
Do? To who?
Did you get some sleep?
Going somewhere?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
That's good. Now what's her name?
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Sophie.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
He never even kids about it.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Mr. Gittes?
Have we ever met?
Never?
When it comes.
Of course not.
Then go home and forget about it.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He did or he didn't?
They were partners.
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
Yeah?
Course, she settled down nicely.
What are you doing here?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
Now what can you see?
You weren't expecting me?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
You understand now? You see it clearly?
I don't care. I'll wait.
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
How long's it been shut?
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
Go in and ask him to hurry.
I might make him nervous.
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
Who else did you see?
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
And the notice?
Is it good?
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
I know that, Emily -
I know it is, Brad -
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
You've got some on your face.
What's funny now?
Where's the towel?
Thanks.
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
Impossible!  Impossible!
You goin', Mom?
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Close the door, Raymond.
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
I mean I've got a job for you.
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Yes?
Why not?
What do you mean by that?
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
I'll sign those papers -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Yeah, all in crates.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Yes and no.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
Well, if it's already too late...
It's not the same.
Thanks. Have a good one.
Excuse me, but...
Fifty-five.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
That's it, everybody out.
Yeah, but not in here.
She said not to come home until graduation.
You can hold me down.
When did you get back?
It's not what you think.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Was I right?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
You work in a market, all right.
Sang.
He's not invited.
You're such an asshole.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Then who operated the store?
This is the last time I come to this place.
Are you open?
Excuse me, do you have...
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
Shit!
What smells like shoe polish?
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Five years.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
Great story, isn't it?
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
Yeah.
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
The milkmaids.
Which ones?
Thirty-seven!
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
Because you buckled.
Don't yell at me, pal.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Design major.
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Julie Dwyer died.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
Broke his neck.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
I can't fucking believe you!!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
Jesus!
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Really?
Holy shit. That girl?
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
What did she say?
What happened to title dictates behavior?
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
There's no lights back there.
This life?
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
Do you work tomorrow?
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
I am not.
Oh for God's sake!
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
What's that mean?
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
The white kind.
The porno mags?
At least they weren't lit.
Why did you agree to come in then?
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
How much money did you leave up there?
Ooh! Can we?!
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
How many?
You've slept with twelve different girls?
You've only had sex with three different people?
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Thank you for being rational.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
I didn't do that!
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Is he staying here?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
You hope what feels good?
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
And... he told you all of this?
I... I don't know what to say.
Dental School.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
Surprise me.
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
Tucker?
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
I'm coming out!
She's losing it!
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
That's a virtue isn't it?
Enough.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Resuscitation?
A flare up...
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
Remember the first time we came up here?
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Gabe are you alright?
No luck?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
Pull it apart!
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Never, what?!
Take the rope.
Take the rope.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Yeah...
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
I don't know about totally.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
What's the delay?
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Don't give him anything.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
What's the code, Travers?
You got what we need?
No names, this is an open line!
Rich...
What did you do that for?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Great, sir. Great.
Help you.
What would you like to know, sir?
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
Do you still feel suicidal?
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
Who said that?
Where is he now, sir?
Fine, fine.
What do I want?
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
Let me get up.
Yes sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
And when do I get out of here then?
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Pitiful rookerful...
D'you think we should do something?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
You need a vacation.
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
I picked up a tail.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
You guys been holding hands?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
I never bought that.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
What if they're wrong?
I was with Max when he got the call.
Quite an achievement...
I'm in town for a short time.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
...why is everything always about you...
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
Max.
58th and Central.  You know it?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
So what?
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Vincent?
Jazz.  Music.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
Limos, huh?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
It's what I do for a living.
There you go...!
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
Slow the hell down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
What happened?
She must be some girl.
I never told her.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Saved you last night's, too.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
I don't see the connection.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
What was your horse's name?
I bit the bastard's nose off.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
You saved my life.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
Yes.
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
That's it?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
If my universe had a hub...
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
What are you doing?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
So what's the question?
He's why you punish yourself.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Murdered?
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
What is it?
We're going to Queens?
My father's house.
Love at first sight?
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
Blue moon...
They changed Franklin's portrait.
Do I know you?
What's that?
Thank you.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
And you feel bad for it?
<u>Why you</u>?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
A dog.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
Night after that?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Yes.
Ah, your psychotic is here.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
Which way did he go?
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Agent Lowry.
I want to believe you, too.
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
Is it possible...?
What in the hell...?
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
You know why I'm here.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
You mean --
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
How can that be?
J39 Z186...?
Got a bogey, boss?
How's the spying tonight, guys?
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
There is no direct evidence, no.
Could we hear to the moon?
Pensacola.
Can you show me?
So.  What happens now?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
That isn't the way it works.
No more stalling, Captain.
It's time to go home now.
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
You live here.
What kind of deal?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
What's that?
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
We could be together again --
But the work --
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Did you love him?
I don't think so.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
What?
What are you so afraid of?
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
Lookit her bounce.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Please! Please!
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Oh lookit that brunette.
Well, whatta we got here?
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
But, Luke...
Luke. Where you goin?
Like I always do?
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh Lord!
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
When are you going to call them?
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
You're fired.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
He was lying.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Because of your phone calls.
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
Would you want to work with us on this?
We'll show that to...
But it's a different m.o.
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
Is that it?
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
I don't want this.  What are they?
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
Tell me what to do!
Don't hang up!
He was in my apartment!
Okay.
I was.
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
I like women like that!
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
How about I put Nikko on it?
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
So what have we got?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
Where you going?
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
Did you come?
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
Do you find him attractive?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
I thought that was you, up there.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
You're kidding.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
What's up with you?
Maybe.
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
You did the right thing.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
I gather he's late as usual.
Yes.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
I haven't had a crush since I was
I'm only looking out for you.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Letty, you should be in bed.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
But you're checking it out.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Really, this isn't funny.
A small price.
We're supposed to be asleep.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
What else would you do?
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Well?
I love the pillows.
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
This must be Beast.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
I think I should go home.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Silly?   Silly am I?
I guess we need to talk.
I sure know what that feels like.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
Yeah?
I hope it wasn't something I did.
No, you've done a perfect job.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
Getting back.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
All tapped out.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
They left about a half hour ago.
Hey man, you can't do that!
Who?
Oui.
No.
You've already robbed the safe?
Hello?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Okay.   How much?
Why are you here?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Get that, will you?
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
You're sure?
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
We still have to get out of here.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
Hadley --
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Anybody hungry?
What?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Does it really matter what I say?
Why haven't you turned us in?
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
Yeah, French guys from France.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
Yes.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
It's good.
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
Give it to me, Sami.
How's my brother?
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
You're not helping.
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
I can't even hear myself think.
They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
You like shoes?
Sounds boring.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yes.
Where's your master?
Do you think you are a real master?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
Tell me, who is your master?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Please sit.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
Please.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
I'll give them to you.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
You shouldn't have come.
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Don't send me back!
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
Don't you want to see her again.
Save your strength.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
I don't know...
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
You look like a rock star without a job.
Mister Funboy.
Do you feel okay.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
I wish to possess what you have now.
Miss her?
Get it?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Don't waste my time.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
I'm Kathryn.
Have we met?
Did you know Sebastian well?
Thank you.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
So what year are you going into?
Got a boyfriend back home?
You a lesbo?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
I sincerely doubt it.
Thank you.
Shut up.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
It was fine.
I don't.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Lighten up.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Hi.
Why aren't you understanding?
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
The football stud?
What do you mean?
Are you shitting me?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
What are the boys like?
What was that?
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Who is it?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Why didn't you do something?
What do I do then?
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
What year are you in?
What are you doing?
You think?
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Hi, mom.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes.
Yes!
Where is she?!
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Nothing.
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
Oh come on. For her first time?
No, tell me.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
It clearly is why.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Why so nervous?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
I thought we should celebrate.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
She's not here.
She's out.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Right after we played backgammon.
What time is it?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Hey Ronald.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
You get your wish!
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
Mommy --
Did you ever make a wish?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
She was very pretty.
Irena.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
Something's haywire,
Did you hear the child out?
Where did you get it?
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
Hello, Amy.
Amy, not that old tree!
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
Why didn't you run after them?
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Can't you get it, darling?
But you must!
That's right!
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
Oh, how beautiful!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
You mustn't be afraid.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
It got hit.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
And does he kill people?
Hurry, hurry.
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
What?
Wow your body's really hot.
There was a sale.
How have you been feeling?
He's a very talented musician.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
He hasn't said one word to me.
Where are all the mediums?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
So did you do it?
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
And then?
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
What the hell is the tampon test?
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
What did he say?
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
You're such a good friend.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
The Nielson's?
You busted me.
Yeah. Maybe.
What's wrong?
You had a date with Carlton?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
What happened?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Hello?
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
I'm going to take a shower.
No, it was our first date.
No, I have a cat.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
It's for you. Frida.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You want her sheets?
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
I need something to keep me awake.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
I韛e taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompson韘 office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
You won韙 regret this, sir.
I don't know who they are.
Such a joker!  Like your father.
Where does it lead?
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Water?
Bad dreams?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
How do you know I'm innocent?
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Don't say a .
Holy cow.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
The Washington Post.
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
I don't give a shit.
Till what?
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Check his kids.
Nobody's got clean kids.
Uh, let me get back to you...
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
No!...  WE didn't anything...
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
What do you mean by that?
So you want to go swimming?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
What happened?
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Presence.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
We've got to fix this.
You ever think back to how you started.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
That was quite a thing you did today.
Where's home?
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
I never thought I'd...
The Monroe?
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
Help me get him to the boat.
His madness....could be from shock.
What is it?
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
Curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
What?
How long do we have to watch him?
This stuff really works? No shit?
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
NOOOOOOOOO!
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
Step up here, Tyler.
It's been fired.
Tricks...Jesus...
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
It will?  How do you figure?
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
So?
What do you mean you don't know?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Mr. Keating!
Yes sir.
You know what really excites me about you?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Don't stop.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
You what?!  How did you do that?
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
It's all right, Chet.
What are you doing?!
Pleased to meet you.
Knox, I don't believe this!
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
Uh-huh.
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Again!  Louder!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Where are you going?
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Father!
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
What?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Come on, that's impossible.
But if he said no before then...
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Oh..
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
You the Captain?
Who?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Right here...middle of nowhere...
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Who gives a shit about aft?
Like cattle...
What is it?
Let's just keep going.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Shut up! You hear me!!
Joey...it's okay...
Joey... Which way's aft?
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
I mean...where is everbody?
Someone's back there.
She fucked me too.
She fucked us both.
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
I'll get the boots.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Nick's going?
Here's to huntin'.
Ammo! Get the ammo!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
That's new, isn't it?
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
You're back.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
I have to go.
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
Where's it gone?
No?
Not so good.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
What are you doing?
You can do it, Sal.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
Fucking A.
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Pow?
Hey, Nick?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
No way. No fucking way!
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
Here, here! This is it!
No.
No.
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
What's that noise?
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
Yeah.
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Speak up.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
Give it to me.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
I want to stop aging.
I'm wasting time.
Kill him... kill him.
You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Sir---
I have to go home, Sanchez.
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Can I ask you something?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Why?
You need anything else?
Wallet, cash, I.D...
Sanchez...?
You treat her nice.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
I just heard.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
You're lying.
You know that you're in my house.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Say ... about the interest ...
Loan shark -- hey?
You're not -- Dorothy.
Stevens!
Mornin', Jabez ...
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
Now run along, Daniel.
No, no! Give it to me!
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
What -- what's on your mind?
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
How much?
Jabez -- help!
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
But I'm glad to be home again --
Worried!
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Mary --
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
You know that, son.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
Ma -- is she? --
I want you to fix these fish!
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Come in, Sheriff.
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Just someone from New Hampshire!
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Me?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I can't be honest with them.
I'm John McClane.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Three down, four to go --
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
Roy?  You still with us?
They way you drive, I can see why.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
These seats come out?
Jesus, you're the man!
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
It looks like a whole roast.
What guns?
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Well.... huh ...
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
Yeah...
What are you talking about?
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
I know!
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Yeah.
I don't have a choice.
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
You frisk me.
You tryin' to fuck me?
Well, what were you doin' back there?
Yeah?
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
Hey... let him out!
What's the matter with you?
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Are you a lawyer?
What is it, Sam?
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
It's up to you ladies.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Because I don't want cancer.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
It's the cops.  Shit!
You mean that?
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
We won't have to.
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
What'd he say?
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Here's your document, Sonny.
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
We can't stay here.
Why are you doing this?
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
You could give up.
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>

I don't know.
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.

<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Can you tell?
Something is going down. Something bad.
Many times.
We're late.
You were good.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
What did he do this time?
So?
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
Make it plain.
What can you say?
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
My name is Eddie.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
I'll see you out.
...peanuts.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
WAKE UP!
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
We both do.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
What else?
Why you gotta curse?
Later for you.
Be a man.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
It's e-vit-able.
Mister Se駉r Love Daddy is cool.
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
Get the broom.
Some are OK.
Mookie's OK.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Hey!  Watch it.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
How ya doin', Mookie?
You're it.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
HARRY!
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Just down the hall.
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Home school? What's that?
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
No no no no no.
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
Who's Principal Collins?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
H A R R Y...
Just a guy I hang out with.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
HARRY.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
These are really cold, huh?
Who's your partner?
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
George Washington!
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Hey, look. Ice cream.
I... found that rock.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
What?
She's one of a kind.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
TURK, leave him alone.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
Do I know you?
You really are a pirate.
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Have you got what I want?
How was that?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
I'm not sure if I can do this.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
You said "aloha" twice.
And, take some more pictures.
Knock knock.
So what do you keep in there?
Where is it?
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
Yes?
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
So, this is Leto the Just...
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
As the legend says.
Do you know this my lady?
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
Is he....?
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Run!
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Always?
Liet?
The Water of Life.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
Did they try and fail?
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
Who are you?  What do you want?
Why were you buying a coffin?
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Are you sure this is okay?
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
Let me take you to the hospital.
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
"It is my home."
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
Bela, are you ready?
You'll be sitting on the right.
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Don't you have any savings?
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
What happened?!
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
What do you think you're doin'?!
Wow.
It takes me comfortable.
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
I'm going to my mother's.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
I like to think so.
So, Mr. Johnson --
I think you're quite handsome.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
Tor, I should be getting home.
Excuse me, Sir...?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
How long's he been here?
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
You're sure this is gonna work?
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
I thought this was a group effort.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
What did you study?
Uh-huh?
They tore her dress! ...
Ed --
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Send him away.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
I mean, that worked out.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
St. Joseph's.
Who?
What?
Oh my god! On TV!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Hi, Mom. 
Hi. Is Shari here?
What is she, at work?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Hey, Lou.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Cream rinse?
What do you want?!
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Oh my God.
What are you doing?
I wish my stepfather was here.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Shari, I really like you...
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Twenty-nine.
I need to talk.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
This is going right up your ass.
Kinda'.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Who is it?
Check forging.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
But you haven't written your novel.
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
What d'you got?
Tracy.
Here they are.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Why are you doing this?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
What's this?
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
What is it. Tammy?
And when did you do it?
I don't believe you.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
And she's super-nice
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
Are you crazy?
People can see this.
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yeah.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
Somebody hit you?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Did you talk to Exley?
Yeah, I hate them.
<u>What do you want</u>?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
What happened?
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
What?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
Richard Stensland.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
Whose shoe?
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
You're wrong.
No.
Yes, I do, sir.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
Something like that.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
L.A.P.D.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
So what's the point?
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
No.
Really?  What did White say?
I'll take your word for it.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
My daughter was a virgin!
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Not a word.
Shut up!
Pacific Coast Bell.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
You've got it on tape?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
I don't know what that means.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
What if--
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Here?
Drive.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What if <u>what</u>?
How?
Reynolds.
Feeling lucky?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
It's a little late for that.
What size?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
Than why can't you tell me.
Did he give you anything?
Was he with anyone?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
What do you mean?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
I've seen it.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Oh, please--
Stacy, don't hang up.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Is Eric in school?
Does that hurt?
Are you sure you're safe?
Is it over?
Maybe it's not connected yet.
My suitcase--
What can I do for you?
Is this a fuckin' joke?
That ain't me.
You don't know who the fuck--
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Never.
Thank you.
I gotta go.
You being audited?
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
Any idea what he looks like?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
What's his name?
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Sure, go ahead.
Who won the fight?
I love my blender.
Can I talk to you a second?
He's heard that it's escalated.
Jerry--
Jerry--
You gotta--
No, I--
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Are you okay?
Well we'd sure like to help you.
It means who's side are you on?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
What?
What happened?
What about the tapes?
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
Yes sir.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
What about--
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
How much did you pay?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
You felt obliged to.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
What's this?
We took several photographs, there's no need.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Will you please come in?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Say you're sick.
I can still taste you.
This is - what is this?
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
Why did you hold his collar?
Dance with me.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
Tell me about your garden.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Very well.
Have you seen Katharine?
It's Geoffrey under this.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Do you have your papers, sir?
If I could just see some identification.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
When's Clifton picking you up?
May God make safety your companion.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
David Caravaggio.
Is this you?
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Where did you find that?
I think that's called looting.
Well, then ask him his name!
Hello.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
Oh, all over.
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Candaules厃ou're laughing at me.
Could I have a cigarette?
Excuse me -
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire? I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
Why would anyone do this?
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once?He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
I mean home.  India.
It's what I've learned.
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
Only we have to go to work.
What's happening?  Am I needed?
Yessir.
Katharine!
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
I'll come with you.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
This is wonderful!
Kip?
What about your rank or serial number?
Meaning--
And the draft blew over the flowers.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Where are you at least?
Gin? Where the hell are you?
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
The Empress Death Mask.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
But Roki said--
Maybe I should drive this time.
It's a test.
It's a fake.
He says they turned the card down.
It's one way.
What's my problem? You want a list?
Lose something?
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
And good morning.
Nice spot.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
Someone was expecting that.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
So how long to pop the floor?
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
That's it. We're ready.
You were afraid of heights?
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
They moved it.
Careful...careful.
What?
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
What about the rules?
The eight billion. From them to us.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
That's where the Mask comes in.
So how long till we do this?
You can't be serious.
Not for me.
The key to success is using the right tools.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Tonight your league night?
This is just show and tell.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
My friend, you always surprise me.
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
250,000?
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
Jesus.
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
I don't even know how much money that is.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
I'm sorry, Erin.
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a r萻um? make an --
All I have is hundreds.
You do know how to do that, don't you?
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
So what made you think it was?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
What do you mean?
I like this case.
Hey.  I like working with you.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
What's a demur?
Why good?
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Fuck Kurt.
I did.  Both.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Two million dollars?
Who's the judge?
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
PG& -- Are you sure?
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Whose number do you need?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Which number do you want, George?
Cause I don't even know you.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
You're not nothing, Erin.
What's going on?  What are you doing?
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
They up?
I'm embarrassed.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
What?
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
There's something else, too.
What?
Dr. Paulsen?
Yes, My Lord.
My lord.
I can't ...
Barks a blue streak.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Howls.
Give me that!
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Yes sir!
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
I think we're in trouble.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Stop that.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
I was worried about you.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
This ought to be good.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
What about Han?
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
A tremor!
What??
Rather touchy, aren't they.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Leia!
This hyperdrive had better work.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
I don't believe it.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
But tell me why ...
Ben?  Ben?
My mind fills with so many images.
I see a city in the clouds.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
The Hoth System?
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
It won't get through the blockade.
Zira, are you mad?
What, Lewis?
With food?
What are they doing here?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
I need a favor.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
She's in the green.
Got a smoke?
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
Where are they?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Me too?
What're you doing in here?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
What are they?
Don't follow me.
Snake - what is it?
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
All of us?
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
Thanks to God, you are alive.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
But your life and lands are far from here.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
I want to thank you.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
What book is that?
What?!
A king must marry, after all.
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
What is this place, Merlin?
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
Who does it serve?
Who?!
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
You are truly magnificent!
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
I'm sorry.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Didn't who tell me?
What's Burke got to do with it?
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
It's serious?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
But it's clean?
Morning.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Lies?
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
On what?
You wouldn't.
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Did you know my mother died recently?
No, is Regan aware of it?
Have you told him what's happening?
What did you do today?
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Where?
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
Think you can sleep?
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Where's Regan?
Quod nomen mihi est?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
No.
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
You're not my mother!!!
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Give me the keys!
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Jack.
Don't make trouble, all right?
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
What d'ya got?,
Really.  You sleeping?
Seeing anyone in particular?
This time you gotta go.
So what'd we get her?
Yeah?
Frank?
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
So you'll come out, right?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
The hell you don't.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Sure, why not.
I'm not unhappy.
What are you, crazy?
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
I thought we had separate rooms.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Unless you want the right.
All night?
How dare you say you love me.
Really.
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
What're you doing down here?
Expensive hangover.
They were simple songs.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
Be reasonable, Jack.
Nothing. We get nothing.
You don't know?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Fuck you.
Jack!
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Right.
Go ahead.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
Charlie called.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
The audience was a little off tonight.
You sure?
Sick?  How sick?
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
So?
What-?
That!  You can't wear that!
Save it for your wife.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Nine!
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Got another song for us?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Uh ...
Some discussion.
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Thanks.
No.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
You miss him, don't you?
You never sang before?
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
He takes after our mother.
Forget it.
So why's he do it?
How do you do it? Every night?
What's the matter?
All I said was you were good.
You were good.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
Yeah... No.
Jack.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
My days are not the old days, genius.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Jack.
Big piece or little?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Nice-looking kid.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
And this thing can grow it?
Why would he need more?
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
For being one helluva guy.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
I'm late for surgery.
... I was dreaming ...
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Who is this?
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
How's Loomis?
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
You merciless bastard!
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
... That's great.
What are you doing?
Oh, and Oxxford called...
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Take you, for instance...
Rise...and...shine...!
Mom, don抰 you think we need to open the presents?
This isn抰 my real life. It抯 just a glimpse...
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Try not to be late because kids don抰 like to be the last one picked up.
Where do I go now?
Trouble at work?
You see, it抯 like we抮e in each other抯 heads...
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn抰 the life I dreamt about.  Where抯 the romance, where抯 the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can抰 have...
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Yes you do...
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
No?  C抦on, Jack...I抳e got everything I need, I don抰 have regrets, that抯 just not for me... sound familiar?
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Finger food...?
Mushroom puffs aren抰 the only thing I do well...
Evelyn, right?
Something like that.
Are we...?
Are we finally being honest?
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Go. I抦 sorry, you should just go...
Jack...don抰 even start...
She抯 your dog, Jack.
Uh...that baby抯 crying...
Wait a second.  You want me, don抰 you?
Shouldn抰 we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
How can you do that?
No?
You want the cake!?
C抦on, you know what I like to hear...
Here抯 the thing.  I really hadn抰 planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary抯 good all day...
Now I抦 worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we抣l deal with it.
Good things...
I can抰 believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn抰 want to raise the kids here?
What抯 going on?
Don抰 do this, Jack... But he continues...
It抯 because I抦 shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
I need you, tiger..
Peter Lassiter...
...we抮e really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
I want to see you again.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Don't you have anywhere to go?
I mean...
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
How long was I out?
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
I'll be watching over you.
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
Ben?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
Ben, come in.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
He didn't.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Apparently I can disappear.
You're really cramping my style here.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Then what is it?
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Feeling better?
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What's going on?
You said it was urgent.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
What're you getting at?
Benes... What the devil happened?
How bad off is he?
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Trip? Where to?
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Just one, General...
Listen...the Heart.
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
What is it?  Anything wrong?
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
But that isn't possible.
We can't take a second more.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
It's against my better Judgment...
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
About forty miles an hour.
A what?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Looks like quite a way to go...
What'd you do that for?
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
Any reserve air?
How's it look?
That's it...
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
The Wall's transparent...
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
Where is Pancakes Hause?
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
Clear him off the road.
Well, okay, it's -
That's right. And we need more money.
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
A subconscious-type thing.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
... I'm sorry, sir?
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Yah, real good.
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yah, so we're all set.
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Yah.
...Dad?
Yah, pretty good.
Norstars.
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, that's okay, I just -
Hiya, Lou.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
...Well, that passed.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You look in his citation book?
Yah?
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
Better times.
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Was it reasonable?
Your mallard?
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
The first rule of Project --
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
I'm in pain.
We need to talk.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
I'll take the parasites.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
That's the idea -- we split them.
This could go on for hours.
You feel nothing?
I think everything's okay here.
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Is this a trick?
I'm sorry, I...
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
Why are you doing this?
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
My God, you're shot...
Tyler?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
... and you come home to this.
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
It's getting exciting now.
I mean -- for a living.
Thank you.
What?
Well, uh... great.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
Go ahead.  Say it.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
You?
You're sure?
Promise you won't.
What is this place?
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
What are we doing?
Tyler...
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
You're too young.  Sorry.
"Applicant?"
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
Fuck you.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb?
What the fuck -- ?
Damn it!  God-damn it...
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Really?
Did you hear what I just said?!
What are you doing?!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
I... I don't know...
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
You have to tell us now.
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
Please.  It's not going to wait.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
What's going on here?
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
What is it?  What are you?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
Can I ask you a question?
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
What on Earth are they doing?
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
This place?!
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Again.
Gettin' old, huh?
That's what I'm here for.
You okay?
What do you call that?
Batteries not included.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
What's she saying?
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
You never been in one of those things.
How do we get upriver?
Where did you find this clown?
How did you get started working for the spooks?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Why'd they want us?
Christ.  How'd you get here?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
Stay on your heading, Captain.
That's an order.
You pathetic scum.
Why me?
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
I know...
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
No really..I can't.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
<u>What</u>!
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
Hello....congratulations.
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
... What?... You don't want to commute?
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Where you comin' from?!
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Hello Lydia?
A list.
Well there....  What's the difference?
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
Will you shut-up!!!
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
It's such a great song.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
You a fag too?
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
How do you know him?
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Well, it's enough for me.
I never say anything I have to.
Excuse me...
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
No, I...
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Is it my turn again?
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I'm sorry.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Okay, Ray...
Alaska.
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
I don't make the rules.
You want me to hold the chicken.
Wasn't it, ladies?
Robert Eroica...
I just can't look at you.
Oh.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Daddy's very ill.
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
It's not that bad.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Where is she, anyway?
But what about me?
Bye, now.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
Why?
You had no inner feeling?
You think I'm a fake.
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
No inner feeling.
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Robert?
Where are you going?
I have to talk to you.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
Robert, do you mind?
What kind of doggy is that?
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
And what about love?
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
Yeah, it could be adorable...
Pardon me?
Miss Dupea.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Fine.
Not now, I'm busy
Do you have a name?
You know somebody around here?
So wadda you do with your girls?
How you treat them?
Where you goin'?
I think by Twenty-two.
A bad attitude.
I think he's 18 or 17.
You sure?
How do I know you're not lying.
No.
Where you know Amanda from?
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
Fletch F. Fletch
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
You can't keep me here.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
Two bs?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
It抯 okay. The cops did it.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
I have the same problem with my help.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Do you have a passport?
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
Cute young thing, too.
She's cute as a button.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
That's a strange combination.
I bet you do.
Alan's in Utah.
You ordered it here?
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
Why'd you let me in?
So?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
What is this....
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I commend him on his choice.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
I never read the paper.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
I said, I ain't got you...
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
Did she tell you anything?
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
You're saying you need money.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
I came to warn you...
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Got those Vomit invites here...
Hey, they blew me.
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
Are you okay?
Nice left you got there, jerk.
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
It's me.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
Well, hello, Ford.
Kill them.  Not quickly.
You'd said something about proof...
How nice.
So...
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Il est en retard.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
It's beautiful.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
What's your story?
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
Des Moines.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Where's he from?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
No, you?
The greaser with the blonde.
Why not?
What about Sal?
Timezit?
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
It was a crematorium.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
You're shitting me!
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
Where's Johnny?
You give him his drops?
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
I swear, Satch.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Where are you transmitting from?
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
Oh my god.
You just burned the desk.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
It's really you, isn't it?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What?
When?
But that's tomorrow.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
Are you alright"?
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
Whatta you mean she's not here?
Whatta you mean...
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
What do I tell them?
Hang on a sec, John.
John, you still there?
What?
He took your wallet?
I got it.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
My father didn't die in a fire?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Huh?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Got a minute?
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
You used to be on the job?
Nah, just working the job.
Hell-
Sullivan?
Fuck you, asshole.
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
You're all just jealous.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
How about a roll in the hay?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
I'm a slow eater.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
And, what about us?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
Could we move a little faster?
You know him?
Hi.
What d'ya got in there?
Faster!  Eat faster!
This is no time to celebrate!
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
....with a woman's touch.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Jason who?
What it is?
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
So what are ya drawin'?
That's debatable.
He didn't say anything?
What's goin' on?
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Eight times.
Well, let's hope not!
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
Jason Voorhees is dead.
Legs giving you trouble?
Steven buggin' you?
Jesus!
It was a community service.
What are you doing?
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
How many times do you want to hear this?
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
That's disgusting.
I'm literally going to kill you!
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
Have you seen Tamara?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
That was truly excellent.
Time to check out the waiters.
Right.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Where's the radio?
Jason's here in New York.
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What a beautiful day.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Get in the boat, Rennie!
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
Rennie...
I got you a present.
I didn't mean for you to go!
You have to call the police...
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
Don't talk like that.
Very dangerous.
We must abandon.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
It's just a review.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
Where are you going?
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
We're making too much of this.
How do you Eknow.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
What are we talking about?
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
It's your best play, Nicky.
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
Why won't you tell me your name?
Your father said you might be here.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
I am really, deeply sorry.
People are dependable.
This could be it!
Life is true.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
We must have been heroic.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
A grandmother. God bless you.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Then say it.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
Don't worry. It's a test.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
'm not worried about this kid.
Postpone. We have every right.
Have to hurry back.
This could be it.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
He wears a disguise.
Do you think he can do it?
Home.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
God gave you ten thumbs.
Just an admirer...
That was lucky.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
What are you doing?
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
You mean Gandhi?
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
What can we do?
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
And Jinnah?
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
You're an ambitious man.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
You've done me a great service.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
From what budget?
Twelve have a mission within the week.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
Call German.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
How was your evening?
Again?
Where are you taking her?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
Hello?
How are you, Jerome?
Where are you going?
What will happen to the others?
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--

Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Where?
I can't.
My medication.  I left it back there.
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
I've got enough here.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
All it takes is a long arm.
I'll take care of my end.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
We'll try again.
You okay?
Feel good?
Where do you want to go?
Just like old times?
Half a million.
How's Estelle?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
Why are you laughing?
That doesn't hurt.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
There better be a guy with the
Do you mean that?
You're full of ifs.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
How much?
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Can we make it?
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
What is it?
Where's home?
No, I'm not.
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Yeah. I got out.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
That's what I want.
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
You can trust him...
I've got to stop.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
Yes.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
What did he say?
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Who paid you to see me off?
And what was that?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
I want to give you an Oscar.
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Thanks for coming.
Where's that?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Did they give you a rough time?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
I'm staying with a friend.
It's not like that, luv.
What'll they do to him?
So shut up.
Do us a favour?
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Not going, Jack?
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
What's that? A hundred?
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
Polacks and deadbeats.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
It is.
It's too...
That's right?
...that's right...
Shoes, boots, yes...
The nurses?
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
...you're absolutely right.
They have...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Yes.
Someone should rob the office.
How many leads have we got?
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
We're just "talking" about it.
As an idea.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
You're actually talking about this?
You're going to steal the leads?
Me?
Yes.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
...you don't have to come in...
...I thought that we were only talking...
Me?
That's ridiculous.
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
In the abstract...
I, you know, they should be insured.
Clear...
He said he filed...
They stole...
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
Yeah.
Where were you?
Yes.
You have nothing to hide.
Oh, God, I hate this job.
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Aaronow...
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...I only...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
Why?
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
What are we going to say?
I'm not sure I have two.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
You are?
Excuse me...
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
No.  It hadn't.
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
Abso...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Don't.
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
They took the leads?
Fuck you care...?
Harriett...
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Ricky, I...
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
I told you.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
No, Jim.
I'm...
What?
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
Your farewell to the troops?
They got, listen to me...
Aren't you going out today?
...you want to go out today...?
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
We were all upset about that.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Fredo.  Where are you going?
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
The 'patrone' is here.
Where's my wife?
You're going to talk to him now.
Goddamn it, where were you?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
If you need anything, just...
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Go on, tell me.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
And Kay...she's all right?
I want it met.
It might show.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
His brother came to help him.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
You're a considerate young man.
Nothing is more important.
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
Trust me; do as I ask.
On the phone?
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
So what did you think?
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
You ever been married, Hanna?
Then you're as single as I am.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Good morning.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
These are your paintings?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Is this David's doing?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Does that surprise you?
I never thought you were.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Why not?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
I suppose you'd like the top down.
No.  The girl.
Is that really her?
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
That only leaves the rest.
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
I never made it to Korea.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Storm's getting worse.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
So it is going to happen after all.
No.  It won't do.
Why?
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
Need some help?
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
I'm up.  Thanks.
Should you be drinking in your condition?
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
This is the studio where I paint.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
You're serious.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
How are you?
Fish.
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
And this has what to do with me?
What do you want from me?
What's wrong with it -- ?
You seem a little hinked-up ...
Yeah.
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
How are we supposed to--
What does that mean -- ?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
Whatcha got left ... ?
Hey, Kip, what's up?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
No...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
"About what?"
He's gonna kill you -- !
You?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
You hear me?
Toby...
Where'd you find this one?
You boost her -- ?
Where you off to -- ?
He give you an advance -- ?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
Call 911 -
What's with the look?
On account of Mitch?
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
The alarms go off ...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
I do ... I cut "em...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
Where to -- ?
You okay -- ?
She does have one thing you don't.
You remember Junie?
Tell me...
You need him...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
How old are you now, Toby?
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
Why don't you leave him alone?
Which way's out, man -- ?
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
Tell him. It's okay.
What did you hear about that thing?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
I'm gonna need some money.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
What happened? You okay?
What about the schools?
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
You want the melon?
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
What happened to you?
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
You ready?
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
I hate to do dishes.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
How's the woman?
It's a way outta here.
Why didn't you yoke him?
What class?
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Did she get my Double Burger?
Come on, Will...
Did your Uncle get arrested?
What's up guys?
Will you take a check?
How'd you like that course?
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
What is it?
Where is it touching you?
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
Well, I'm sorry.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Thank you.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
So who won the bet?
Would you excuse us?
Why would he do that?
Seems like it's going well.
Jobs doing what?
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
--And confuse him--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
Do you know when you'll be back?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
You're right. I know.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Why thank you.
Well, are you going out again?
My wife's dead.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Why not?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
They could see that I meant it.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
What?
Don't fuck with me.
I'll keep in touch.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
Yeah?
Oh, you will?
You grew up around here?
Yeah.
I have twelve big brothers.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
Why do we always stay here?
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
When?
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
Just for fun?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
You doin' the hirin'?
Ready, Ma?
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
I didn't see nothin'.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
That cut you got?
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Is it fur?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
How about a lift, mister?
Get to what?
You ain't got to get sore.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
Where you going?
Got any plants?
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
Anybody ask anything?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Yes'm, that was it.
Didn' you get no sleep?
Was Granma bad?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
You can have this for ten cents.
Tommy?
How you get all this money?
Here we go!
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Please don't.
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
What do you do?
--Stop it--
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
Bob. Bob Destephano.
It's me. Martin Blank.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
It's always the little things.
Flowers. That's funny.
Shoulda brought my gun.
He was trying to kill you, right!
Not the other way around...?
...About five years now.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
You kill people. 
You went to school with these people.
Say more.
You know where I live?
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Lisbon?
Well?
Did you see Blank in there?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They're not happy, sir.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
I have scruples. Next.
I bought a new rug.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
So what happened to you?
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
How's that?
Why not?
This is Annie MacLean.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
The answer's no.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Thanks.
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Everything under control?
Just make yourself comfortable.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I don't believe this!
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
Did you ask him to come visit?
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
What did you say?
Who is it?
Great!
Yes. We're suing.
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
Okay. We'll see you later then.
I'm sorry.
What did he say?
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
What if she doesn't want to go?
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Good night.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
How are you feeling about work?
Yes?
I have so much to tell you.
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
It's so cruel.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
What was it like?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
- See, what you can do for him --...
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
I don't believe it.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
What does she do?
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
I can't... not yet...
Grace, I need you to come with me.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
Do you want to go around by the old road?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Hey, darlin'.
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
How's it going, Ray?
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
Right.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Ta-da!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Damn!
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
One-handed!
Oh wow, we are fried.
Did you talk to him?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Up all night again, huh?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
How was school?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
Crash Override.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
He's not in this class.
It's too much machine for you.
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
You what?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Alright, so what have we got?
There they are!
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
Ready?
Dade.
Oh, wow, she's great.
You look good in a dress.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Gill.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Never fear. I is here.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
What the hell was that all about?
What?
Murphy kid turn you down?
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Just one moment.
You're late.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
I'll take you down there.
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
We need to talk.
When did you find this out?
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Are you two okay?
What's going on?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Brady!
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Why wasn't I notified?
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Has he been prepped?
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
Sure it does.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
Hi.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Had enough?
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You won't look pushy.
Where are you going?
Do you?
I am. Ben Meeker.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
How's it powered?
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
Why didn't you wait for me?
Hello?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I've already lost it.
Sure, see you later.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
You idiot!
Go get me a beer.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Anybody live here?
A man wouldn't do that...
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Well, she's totally not here.
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
Laurie...
What about the bogyman?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
There WAS.
Right.
Promise?
How?
Yes, she is.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Ever done anything like this before?
I see.
I couldn't if I tried.
Yeah.
We're a big hit.
It's French, though.  It really is.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Is this your first job?
Yeah.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
...with the affiliates.
Like, uh...?
Hi.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
And you're in love overnight?
Lee...
Mm-hm?
They're fantastic.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
She has all the cooking talent.
Where're you going?
Why not?
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
No!
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Why should I be afraid?
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Me?
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
N-n-no, not that.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
Yes!
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Hey!
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Uh-huh.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Hey, hi!
Oh, God...
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
You treat me like a loser.
What's the matter?
Good.
Oh, so loosely.
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
No, you can tell me.
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh!
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Hi.
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
...<u>please</u>...
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
We could skip the Gavotte.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Evelda Drumgo.
That's right.
...nightmare.
...are they hard to get?
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
<u>Do</u> it...
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
He escaped...
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
...they're from Baltimore....
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
And how would you know that?
...unmarked hundreds....
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Look at this:
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
A fellow with five fingers.
No. 
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
Waal...
What'd you say, hon...?
Waited too long, hon...?  
Waal...
Give it up.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
You know America?
Darling...
I've left my <u>program</u>...
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
...Franklin.
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
And you let her get away.
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
No, I don't get you...
...may be the heat....
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
What's that, Baby?
Look what they put her on...
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
...what...?
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Don't shoot yourself.
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
...<u>sadly</u>...
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
...what a lovely perfume.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Talia, don't go!
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
That would be a No.
Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling.

Fuck off.
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
God, you're beautiful.

Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
So, are you a cheerleader?
Gee, thanks.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Things are going to change, Earl.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
What are you doing?
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
No way, no day!
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
And your worst enemy.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Mute!
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
We killed them, didn't we?
Did to.
Did to.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
You're still not listening! I'm not..
This knife is filthy.
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
You going to eat this?
We on tonight man?
Cool off, we're seniors.
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
He's the manager!
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
I'm so happy to see you!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
looks startled at the outburst.
But, we're all going to Heaven!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
I shall call him Diello.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
John has fallen in love with me!
I think I'm going crazy.
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Mummy!
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Pitbull attacks.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
Sorry.
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
Bret... what the fuck...?
Hello I'm Dr...
You could say that.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
Never to put you in my will.
You're alive...
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
Poor Trevor.
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Last week...
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
Often, uh.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Bernie, how'sa kid?
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Turn that thing off.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
You were... very... inspiring.
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
What is it?
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
We're piecing together different accounts and...
How'd it go?
Ticket!  What's going on?
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
She wants to quit?
Helluva story!
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
As long as you keep remembering why.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Where'd he go?
Neil, calm down.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
Did you hear what he said?
How was lunch?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
How long does it have to be a new house?
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
He wants to see me!
That's not the case.
Who was that?
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
How large is your brood?
It's fun.
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Even better.
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
Anything from the bank?
He had to come from somewhere.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
What?
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
You?
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
It will be a good harvest this year.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
Different places.
Sometimes.
I cannot stay.
Then take me with you.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Where did you get it?
You're not an easy person to get to know.
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
On the back it has--
Where will you go now?
Be careful, Conner.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
Is there anything else you need?
What are you doing?
What will you do?
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
Talley.
What'd you find out?
You get anything on Smith?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
You should warn them, Sonny.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
I guess not.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Jen?  Are you all right?
Who sent you?
Bullshit!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
There is no way out.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
Talley?
You're a funny guy, Talley.
We been through that.  Forget it.
Let me come get him.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
Can you identify this man?
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
What if it goes south?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
I'm scared shitless.
Ow!  Shit!
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Want one?
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
You gotta pee?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
That's enough.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Sounds like you know the job.
You want me to stick around, I could --
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
What do you want me to do?
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
Can you open them?
Are the disks still in your room?
Did you find the disks?
Who are you?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Paul!
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
I used to work at the Diplomat.
You want to pay me?
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
Anything. Strong.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
They fired a rocket at us.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
I will see what I can do.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
When?
You know what the Scottish call it?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
We are better here.
You are a marked man.
You will tell them the truth.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
Let抯 go, Jock.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Who did you call?
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Excuse me.
How much?
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Let's have dinner first.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
No.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
This won't do.
How can we help him.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
They are being evacuated.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
A car.
What does it matter.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
We are almost out of water.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
You have taken business class?
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
I don't know.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
Melissa!
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
Oh, really: who?
This thing's going nowhere.
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
You said that was an accident.
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Oh. Jesus.
Pritchett, is that you?
Oh, Jesus....
-- closed.
Why not?
Good point.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
...Jesus H. Christ.
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Could we have a word?
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
Do something!
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
I'm ready now.
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
What is it??
-- the window and door grates --
Well, I don't.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
It works.
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Ghosts killed your father?
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
-- Eddie!!
Something....happened --
Town records are coming up now.
Are you all right?
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
Where does this amulet come from?
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
By freeing them.
It's going to hurt us!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
What about all my other stuff?
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
She's here.
She's down.  Help her...
I want this one, daddy.
Why?
Look daddy!  It's empty!
I can't move!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Mommy!
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
It's just going to take a while.
I wish I knew more about her.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Oh come on!
Whoa there...
A friend?
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Maura, what is this!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
I think we should do it.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
What was she afraid of?
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
The rain is letting up.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
There's something in there.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
What will he do?  What does he want?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Wha .... ?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
What am I looking for?
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
Uh-huh.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
Yes.
Oh, I don't ...
Yeah right.  Look ...
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
Alex!
Did I miss anything?
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
Count of three?
Now that's a lock.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
How.
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
I'm going to find out.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
And I'll bring my entourage...
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
Wha--
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
I wanna know...
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
Cat got his tongue?
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
Why does this have to be so hard...
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
Snappy.
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
About seven minutes.
A sawbuck!
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
You're from Muncie?!
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Confused?
Smitty.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
...The people look like ants.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
I filed it yesterday.
You can't print that!
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
Ya know, entry level!
I got big ideas, though!
...Geez.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
Awwww, buddy --
Yessir.
...Yeah, go ahead.
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
Well, frankly, I...
Not even behind your back?
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
How's that, Sid?
Yellowstone.
She isn't!
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
You're single?
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
Where do you think you're going?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
That doesn't sound like him.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
It is not beautiful.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
Well?
I wanted to help you.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
You want that?
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
An accident at the mill?
In other words, I'm on trial.
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
You're staring at me.
What do you think?
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
I... I think I am...
The turkey in?
Dinner in ten minutes.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Don't be dim.
It's a starting place.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
You've...
Elena.
Hi dad.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
So how's school treating you?
Anyone special? You know...
See you.
Huh?
Dad stop it!
Good-night dad.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
-- What advice? You never --
-- 73
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
Now you are being rude.
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
I do.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
No one.
Did you tell Sandy?
I don't ever want to see you.
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Wow!
You get in trouble?
Hello, Charles.
Her name's Libbets.
And?
Right.
Just after Leland Street.
So far.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
Who's that?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
He would have liked that.
I'll call him now.
Forget your pager?
No.
That's right.
So?
Are you sure about that?
Eight years.
They're all over everybody.
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
I told you I don't remember.
Thought I smelled something.
I was her best friend.
She wouldn't tell me!
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
She used some stupid code name.
Thought you might find that.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
You're not following procedure.
Who made us what we are?
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
Then blame the one who made her...
You were their leader. They trusted you.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
And if I cut my hair again?
Not you my dear.
Laudanum!
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
We're immortal. You've always known that.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
The ship is sailing wihout us!
Or her, or her - or any of them?
This is monstrous!
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
You want death? Is it death you want?
You've just done it -
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
You really want to be with them?
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
Read her thoughts.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
It's only a siren...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
Shall we go on?
You found nothing?
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
What can I do for you?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Say yes.
That could break the machine.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
But, he said he'd try.
He does work hard.
Hello? Hello?
No way.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
What do you mean?
I don't know...
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Checking the locks again?
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Voodoo.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
Don't kill me --
You sure?
The shower again?
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
This was not my idea.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
What? What are you talking about? Where?
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
I'll come with you.
To a great weekend --
Why? He can't help us.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
Goodbye.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
) You feel the symptoms?
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
Oh, no -?it's too delicious! You're making it up!
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Cathy ? how does it feel to have a father?
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -梠r just because he is one's father?
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are 棗 a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life 棗you've ruined mine 棗
What would I be thinking?
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours 棗 but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man ??working at him ??turning him against Thea.
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
You know that sound, Oliver?
I've seen men die drunk ? and I've seen men die of the plague.
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle ?
Daughter -- my daughter --
You're crying. Why?
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" ?
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
Good morning, sir.
Oh, no.
What did you say?
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Where's Mary?
I . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Who is it?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Today, over at the house.
Hi, Daddy.
There it is, good as new.
What?
It will?
Daddy!
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
What's that?
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Well then, how do you know?
Oh . . .
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
Okay 枛 all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
How's that?
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Got a match?
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Some other time, George.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Hello.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look 枛 if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
Why didn't you call me?
Those Rockefellers!
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Pop!
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in 枛 providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Made up your mind yet?
Well, hello.
I'm not very good at this.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
If I told you it might not come true.
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
About what?
When did you get back?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Where's your coat and hat?
Where're you going?
Oh, George, George!
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
I guess you forgot something.
You can?
Wheee!  Faster!
My hair's getting wet!
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Oh, shit.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
No.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
What is it?
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
We're carrying weight.
Coming up!  Give way!
I don't know.
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
Hey!
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
On your own time?
Positive I.D.?
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
How long ago?
I can't let you take her out.
You're too close.  Back off.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Michael.
Dad, I'm sorry....
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
It came up during the meeting.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Probably.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Eat Cheerios.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
No.
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
That you were fired.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
I'll give notice.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Did he raise the Kids?
Can I go swimming?
What's wrong?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
You're not going out right away, are you?
Mike!  Are you going out?
Whoops, almost lost one.  Can't play with the dolphins without skis....
Terry!  You okay?
Me neither.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
No class.
Anyone know what time it is?
The wind drift is lateral.
Come on back up here!
Give me back my hat!
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Be careful....
What is it?
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
I don't care.
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
Heading back?
Do I have to play with the little kids?
Oh, my God....
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
Pre-opening jitters.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Not enough loving.
What do I do now?
Are you scared?
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
What's wrong?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Where are you going?
How the hell did it get in here?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
You're going down there again?
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Fine piece of engineering.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
No, we'll go through here.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
Michael, take deep breaths.
Yes, you can.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
Somebody better get down there!
How is he?
That's right.
Me.
I am.  You're not.
You don't have to prove anything.
I told you, something's upset them.
Why?
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Believe me, I am.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
I think they'll come out now.
When did this happen?
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Hi, Mike.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
I'm a water-skier.
Sean, do you have herpes?
Besides that.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Yes, it's great!
Told you you'd like it.
Take it up!
Gotta sneeze.
Yes, there is goes.
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
How far away is filter number four?
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Took it this morning.
Come on, let's go.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Off....
Close the door.
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
Michael!  This thing working?
Stop that....
That....
We don't want any....
The fish.  Check it....
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
Don't be late.
Can I ride one sometime...?
I never....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
I'll be in to read you a story.
Sit down, Ma....
I want you to get out of the water....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
All you all right?
Can you just go off...?
It was no accident....
I don't know how....
How do you like flying?
What's wrong?
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
I borrow it without telling him....
You sure you don't need glasses?
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Still tagging conch?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Hey!
They won't fight with me....
Maybe I missed you too....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
What happened to Clarence and...?
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
Okay.. .we're done, man....
Okay...we got it together....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
I don't like it....
How come only me?
What the hell are you doing?
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Who grows more beautiful....
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
The van?
Did you bring it with you?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
Who is who?
Not for me ..
What time is it?
There's nothing in the files?
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
You want my advice?
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
What do you mean?
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
Why?
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
Did he shut you down?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Sure.
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
Listen, you don't havta come?
What is that?
Is this normal?
Did he get you the job?
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
You must have some idea about him.
The elevator wasn't working?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
Who sought the warrant?
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
He's happy, darlin ..
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
She married some English prick.
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Well, no you didn't --
I just heard.
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Oh Jerry.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
... this is... uh... too funny...
No no...
Can I help?
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Oh my God.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Truth?
Me too.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Well.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
What --
And I really don't know your noises yet.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I don't need you to "stick."
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
Wait. Where is he?
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
Oh, thank you.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
You love me now, don't you?
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
What's wrong.
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
That's an answer.
Beautiful.
Oh, tell the story.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
How can I make your life better?
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
I'm sorry what I said back there.
I'm fine.  What's up?
... dick?
Jerry --
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
Let's go the zoo.
I don't see any.
ERRR-IIIC!
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
How much weight have you lost?
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
What did you say!
Young adult.
Eric! Are you here?
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
I don't remember
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
He could have died.
We should try fishing again.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that抯 where he's headed.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
I don抰 know.
How was your trip? Profitable?
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
I CAN GET HIM!
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Do you have any kids?
Bonitas.
Hmmm.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Amanda!
How do you mean?
What are you talking about?
I don't believe you.
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Dad!
Cancel that, Dieter.
Where do you think you're going?!
What kind of gun is that?
What is?
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
?!
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
Something's wrong.
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
So that others would know about this place?
Because it exists.
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
Ian.  It's guano.
These formations.  They're dried --
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
That little black line?
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
WHAT ARE YOU-
Where's Kelly?
Ask her.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
What?
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
How long will this take?
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
The what?
Anything else, you old fossil?
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
Constantly sick.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - a gizzard - -
Alan?!
C'mon on, this way.
I know, it's very exciting.
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
Unpredictability....
Faster, faster!
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
These look kind of familiar.
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
I can't!  I'm scared!
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
Yeah, they hate me.
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
Tim!  Lex!
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
Tim, Tim, Tim....
What's that?
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
Well?
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
That's not funny.
No, but...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Jesus Christ!
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
Two.
What?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
You think that's going to work?
Doesnit sleep?
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Oh?
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
Fascinating.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
What are you doing?
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
What's that?
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Where do you live?
Have you worked here long?
Fine -- terrible.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
Did you see him?
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
I usually take lunch by the River.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
They're not obliged to tell.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Your office is the Workmen's --
Was he depressed?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
Probably not.
I'll bear that in mind.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
Oskar!
This is filed incorrectly!
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
I tell you it doesn't exist!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
Did you see her?
What was it, Jack?
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Are you gonna start it up?
What's that?
Mm.
-- May I? It's so --
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
Yes indeed.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
What about?
Why?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
What? This?
Can't you get him?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
The same as Jane McKenna.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
Please.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
Is that all you have to say?
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
John, how are you?
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Not unusual.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Does that distress you?
What does?
What do you have here, Billy?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Greatest.
When is mommy coming back?
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
You're late.
Okay...Same as usual...
Mom, I mean dad...
I'm sorry.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
All it is is onions and gravy.
Then eat around it.
Is mom ever coming back?
Did mommy ever see this?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
What did you do when you were little?
Your mom.
Objection!
Sustained.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Did you wish to?
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
So do I.
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
A heavy drinker?
Was he unfaithful?
Somewhere in between.
I was not a failure.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
'Night, Jim.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
How should I know?
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
What?
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
I'll take my chances.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
How many?
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
You're sure?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Huh.. .Hello?
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Please, come, Holiness.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Mama, my story.
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
No.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Where will you keep them?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Dalai Lama.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
With much bloodshed.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Where is Alsace?
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
America, we shall see.
Has anyone died?
Did you ever doubt it?
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
Please, come in, so cold.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
This is Britain.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Much too young.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
You killed him.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Go!!!
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
And again.  How would you get him on land?
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
And how would we neutralize him?
I'm okay.
Oh my God.
Baby crocs?
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
You okay?  Kelly?
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Thanks for the... bandaid.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
I'm not mushing it.
Really--
What?
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
Are we crazy?
He's mooing.
We gotta get to Hector!!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
Different worlds, Jack.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
He's done.  He's dying.
Thanks for your help.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
What?
With what?
They don't believe her.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
What is this?
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
Are you alright?
Are you okay?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
Should I?
Sorry?
Are you on drugs?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
No.
Lecter said a lot of things.
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
What girl?
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Miggs has been murdered.
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
Are you finished?
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
You seem pretty sure of that.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
Your bleeding has stopped.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
I heard a strange sound...
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Where were you going?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
Time, Pilch! My move.
Yes, miss.
Why didn't you bury those people?
Your "father"?
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
Will you go back to England?
What?
You still have an aversion to the water?
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Some say that's the way of it.
My God, Alice.
One called Magua arrived.
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Fort Edward, then?
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
Yes, sir.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Excuse me. What did you say?
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Yes.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Such as...?
My colors?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
What's wrong?
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
Doc eat already?
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
Go on!
Your suit, Becky!
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
I need more light on that, Four.
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
We made it!
The internal monitors read normal.
Something wrong, Cobb?
I'm going inside.
Twenty minutes...
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Thank you, Martin.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Made your million, yet?
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Bullshit.
What happened?
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
It's Sixpack!
Burritos...Enchiladas...
I'm going to try to remove it.
What on earth's the matter with you?
Don't spend all day down there.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
I'll kill him!
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Bacon, see what we got.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
You all right back there, mate?
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
And the weed?
Invitations.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
There's nothing in it!
Who's this fat man, then?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
What the hell are you doing here?
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
You got it all?
It's pay day, ain't it?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
Hello, can I help you?
I can't help you, Plank.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Look. Go on, look.
What have you come as?
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
What's left over?'
How many wings have they got between them?
The money, the gear!
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Because it's a job?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
You're dismissed.
Sam the Man.
How's business?
Nice job.
A .45--
Just wondering.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
So?
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
That's not the point.
Whole different story; isn't it?
Same weight I always was.
350 pounds.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
How's your room shaping up?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Hey, Mikey--
Mikey--
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
That where he was shot?
You get much of that in here?
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Es muy lindo, su coche--
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Tell that one, Hollis--
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
That's a matter of interpretation--
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
Bledso
Besides my father, I mean.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
You thought any more about our murder?
I got an idea what happened.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
Fellas.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
We're building up tourism, Sam--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Mami, how old were you when my father--
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
He had the club out on the old trail road--
He squeezed money out of you?
And my father?
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
You gonna stay out here?
You got in late last night.
Can I get this?
Morning, Sheriff.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
He's all yours.
Your boy, there--
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
Yeah?
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
Yeah?
How much?
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
How'd you spell that again?
D'Amour.
You did.  Didn't you?
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
Please.
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
He's with us...
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
How did it go today?
They were jealous of him.
So why did you marry him?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
What did you find?
Stuff?
It's okay.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Yes.
Are you all right?
Oh God!
I've got to help him.
... oh... God...
Valentin?
Sure.
What were you doing up there?
Where the fuck is he?
And this Butterfield guy--
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
Shit.
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
What for?
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Are you satisfied now?
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
How the fuck do you do that?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
... no...
Nobody's better off this wav!
One question.
Have we met before?
What is?
Oh, hi, Elaine.
How long have you been married?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob ?Charlie Brown.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Hello?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
No one ever tells you that...
Four.
What happened to your toe?
Where's your husband?
I'm going to miss you.
Charlotte?
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Lydia?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Hello?
Uh, no.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
Yeah.
I guess she's busy.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Ok.
Hospital?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
I miss you.
John! What are you doing here?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
You never said anything to me...
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Peter, where are you?
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Yes.
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
What is it?
Why are you doing this to me?
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Father, please don't die.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Yes... and you are?
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
I'll bet.
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
What do you mean?
You're sure?  There was nothing?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
What?!?!
You should think about getting professional help.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
I don't understand what's going on.
What are you looking for exactly?
Peter, let go of the chair!
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
You have to say that.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
Oh, Peter.
Good seeing you again.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
It's useless...look at him.
You know what?  You can go.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Parents died?
Ah, Mom.
nothing.
Hi.
Yeah, you met her?
There you go.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
Okay.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
So you're still breast-feeding?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
What?
My mouth is kinda dry.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Hello.
So how long is this trip?
A horse?
You do.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
What's up?
Well, what do you know.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
For real?
I never knew a girl that could play.
I don't know.  A lot.
I don't like flowers.
I think we gotta kiss now.
Way to hoop.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
What was that about?
Hey.
Sorry about your game.
he's just playing, Q...
Who was that?
You want to go talk?
Can we talk?
Least she had time for me.
You forgot to be there.
What are the doctors saying?
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
Cause I don't get it.
What's going on?
I heard enough.
I'll play you.
One game.  One-on-one.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
What?
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
You hearing me?
Guess he talked to you.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Quincy, please...
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
What people?
I just told you.
What's Mom think?
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
From your mouth.
What do you want?
Look, I'm busy.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
What kind of Cancer?
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
...Hello...?
uh...uh...What is it?
What?
Yeah, but I don't know --
Yeah.
No.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
Why not?
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
Yeah, of course.
I lost my gun.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
I'm sorry --
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
It's ok.
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
-- you the resident here?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.

Doc it's Janet.
What happend?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
....do you know who I am?
What?  What does that mean?
That's right.
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
I would just want to clear some things up:
She does.  From when you were a boy.
the valley?
Are you close?
And your father?
And "Frank?"
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
He's in here.
He's in here --?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
I AM CALM.
You're here.
No.  I said that.
I live alone.
No I Said.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
You on any medication?
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
You look great.
No.
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
Will you say my name?
What happend to you?
How you doing?
Did you tell her?
I don't think I want that.
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
...say it, Jimmy...
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
Was it a call back?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
Hello.
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
mmm.hmm.
Bottled Water?
Ok.
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
The fuck is wrong with you?
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
Hi.
Hi.
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
What is that?
No, M'lady.
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
Mother -- ?
I am preparing for a ball!
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
Your Majesty...
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Who is he, Aramis?
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
Poor Phillippe!
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Aramis, this will never --
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
A simple theological discussion.
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
Recent hours have been a shock.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
Betrothed?  I think not.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Where is Michelle?
Did they kill him?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
Did you know... about Raoul?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
Captain Doyle?
What the hell happened?
What did the six-toes have to say?
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
What's this?
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Alright, where is she?
Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
I was just having a little fun -
Did you read today's paper?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
No, but I'm listening.
I had it all on tape...
What?
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
No...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
Oh man...what happened?
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
You must be going somewhere.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Ditched you?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
You don't seem afraid of much.
No.  It wasn't like that!
Don't you guys ever knock?
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
In thirty-five minutes.
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
How much do you know?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
You look all right now.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
For Christ's sake, why?
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Run it.
Tell me now.
Get me a plane!
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
He's a very shy boy...
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
It's getting late and...
It does, doesn't it?
I'll take you.
Ride with me.
You worked out well.
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
I'll get my purse.
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Do you see?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you have it?
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
Can you read it to me?
Linda King's desk.
Yeah...
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
At the store. You doin' some good?
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Do you remember what you said?
Then why?
And... where are things?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
How did it happen?
You went in the apartment?
What kind of coffee do you like?
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
What disadvantage?
Pictures?
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
No.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
You have to do it.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Andy!
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
I'm sorry, George...
How long would they let me sleep?
What was that all about?
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Andy, the theater's that way!
Hi...
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
Have you told your family?
You're NOT DYING!
GET OFF!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
I was very original!
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Positive.
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Why is he saying these things?!
You don't know.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant?
What?!
You got the money?
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Do you?
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
When?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
The beginning?
How does she know?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Now left and that's it in front of you.
Tank.
You're the Oracle?
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
That was a long time ago.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
Of what?
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
God...
Is it?
What is it?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
What are you doing?
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
What are you doing?
Neo, how did you do that?
Can you fly that thing.
It's a city?
What are they doing to him?
How?
How much time?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Which way?  Which way?
Operator.
Cypher, I thought --
Tank, you're hurt.
What just happened?
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
No, all we got is $40.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
May God be with you.
Get out of here before this really goes up.
So?
You got some mouth!
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
Don't come any closer!!!
Shut up!
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Don't you move!!!
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
Disgraceful.
Diane, how are you feeling?
Take a drink!
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
"Francis Macomber."
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Maybe, who knows.
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
No.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
Take your time.  I don't care.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Scumbag--
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
You mean it's heisted.
Just keep him quiet.
Can you spare it?
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Dinner?  Again?
Did you speak to the Governor?
Just plain 'Joe'?
I know you do, darling.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
I haven't been the father to you that --
Honey, please.
What about the Mayor?
...This shit's not bad.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Who are we talking about?
Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
I'm all excited --
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
What are their feelings?
Whose?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
In English, please.
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
Yeah.
He was interested.
He said that?
Doctor lady make it irey.
Can't, sistah.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
Don' need you okayin'.
Jennifer.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
The Board is waiting.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
Goodnight, Joe.
Yes?
Oh goodness, no.
Very well, I'll watch.
She's in a great deal of pain.
Yes...
How long have you been standing there?
No.
Yes?
Did you like making love to me?
Where are you going?
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
We know so little about each other --
I - uh --
No --
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
What a good idea.
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
How long have I got?
Well, thank you for letting me know.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
I'm not everybody.
Yes.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
About Susan?
What's okay?
Uh --
Thanks.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
Which is what?
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
Are you threatening me?
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Please.  Talk to me --
About what?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Drew's aboard?
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
I love him.
What was that?
How'd you know?
I've got to go --
Why?
47.
Burt.
Amnesia?
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
Jimmy?
Is that what your little note says?
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
It's isolated.
I wasn't helping you for money.
His name was Jimmy.
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
Neither do I.
Yes.
They're not looking for him.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Shut your mouth!
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Yup?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
You really want to find this guy?
I don't think so.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
So what are you gonna do now?
Who the fuck are you?
What do you mean "bad news"?
She couldn't.
Happy now?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Your name's Teddy.
I should kill you.							 *
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
What do you think?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
How many?
Make it 40%.
Like...?
Would you find me...?
Is this the protective male talk?
Jos?..
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
I do.  We don't do business with him...
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
Yeah?
And there's Dmitri...
So?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Anything?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
What is going on...?!
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
Detective Crockett.
That's right.
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
So what do you want?
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
You okay?
You mean with the flowers...?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
Conveyance?
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos?knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
What the hell did you do?
The Statue of Liberty.
You sure you heard what I said?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
Oh hell, forget it.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
You don't seem like no fag...
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
They wrong?
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
You're what?
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
What d'you want?
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
Two kilos.
What?
Who?
To what?
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Girlfriend?
Just Erich.
How much did you have?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
Okay?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Never was anybody like you...
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
What'd the Prosecutor say?
His name?
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
Wait a minute-
You feel anything?
Can we get this car there?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
My God, what the hell are you...?
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
Rub it on the windows!
Oh, come on, come on!
You sure you didn't see one of these?
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
It bit you.
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
You're very kind...
What's it about?
I can take it, go ahead.
The profanity bothers you?
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
Then who did?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
Misery's Return?
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
To Misery.
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Well, it certainly says you.
Don't talk to me like that.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Did I do good?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
Yes.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
I thought you were going to dinner.
On what.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Sort it all out.
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
Where?
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
Fight a bit of a cold..
What was the top bid?
Not exactly.  Wallis?
What you got there, mate?
Well do you disagree with that?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
Before we kill her or cure her..
Uh-huh.
What are you doing here?
I wouldn't do that.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
What's you name?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Much.
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Just like old times?
-- his left jacket pocket.
Where do I meet you?
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
'Terrorists?'
Excuse me?
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
I don't.  No exactly.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
It's the transponder.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Now how to get in there.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Come on!
That's S.O.P..
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
What kind of show.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Did we get it?
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Ethan韘 right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
No sir.
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
What makes you trust me?
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
On what?
What was your deal with Job?
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Give me the God damn gum.
Higher.  Higher.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, I韒 coming to you.
Then what am I doing here?
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
How was Chicago?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Where are you?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
What's going on?
That's what we do isn't it?
Thirty-two and change.
Yes...  It韘 him.
Try it again.
Are you ready?
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
You haven't said anything.
You look tired.
Yeah.
The guy died.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
It's temporary.
I got it done.
You're married.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Why?
Loretta. What's that smell?
I like it well done.
Stupid yourself.
She was right to leave me.
What are you doing!
Stop it!
A bride without a head!
I was dead.
What? What have we done?
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
Why not?
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Who painted that?
So. Where are we sitting?
I'm afraid of who I am.
Let me go home.
I'm freezing to death.
Ronny!
No, I'll tell him.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
It's Johnny Cammareri.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
What's the matter?
Have Something.
Yes, on the floor.
What about the wedding?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
He's my younger brother.
Have you told her we're getting married?
Why not?
How's the mother?
No. But I have a hangover.
WHAT!! She was dying!
Do you love him, Loretta?
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
I know.
Don't fight.
So.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
My mother's recovered.
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Then why are you eating alone?
Temperature's dropping.
It's Cosmo's moon.
She's got it.
How do you know she is a witch?
Burn her anyway.
Where did you get the coconuts?
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Well, how did you become king, then?
Oh!
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What, "is"?
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Well, what's that then?
Stop that.
Are you sure he's got one?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Now what happens?
They're nervous, sire.
What?
What?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
Sorry ...
Make a bridge out of her.
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.
What is your name?
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
They cost fifty pounds each!
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
But I don't like her.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
How?
Right.
Well, look er, I ...
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
I done it again.
I speak as I find, Archie.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
What are you doing?!
She'll get over it.
The place is a mess.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Mama...
I'm sorry?
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
Awaiting my orders.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
This is a slur on her good name.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
You sent for me.
Surely --
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
You are here safely.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
What are those?
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
They're ready now.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
I was told you were in a fight.
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
What can we do?
This is my good John Brown.
Should we take it seriously?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
What did he want?
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
Why not?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Then why are you not with him?
What is the matter with him?
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
But how can it change every time?
Dead?
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
No, in person.  Now.
It is.
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
The Police, then...
SLIP-STREAM.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Okay.  It's West.
What did he do to you?
I'm thinking!
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
So what do you think?
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
What do you mean "you know"?
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
What did I say?
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
How...  how'd they know I was here?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Was anyone hurt?
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
What's wrong?
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
I don't know.
Okay... but just...just to see.
Okay.
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
Don't stop!
Rita... I know what you're doing.
Wally Brown.
Yeah, what for?
What's  the matter now?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
You see what I mean...
Nice wallets.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Palmdale.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
Is that it ?
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
Why should we trust you ?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
What are you doing ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
What's the trick here ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I... I .....
This is cute.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
What are you DOING here ?
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Be very, very quiet...
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
Stop the hydraulics.
Hand me the 3/8ths.
You did.
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Zachary.
One moment dear... 
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
Maybe you should get over fears.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
The power went out in half the park.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
How's your foot ?
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
What now ?
He was right behind me !
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Do you still teach?
How did you know my name?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
You want me to move?
Okay, no problem.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
I already bought a ticket.
No nuns, got it.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Maybe he's wet?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
That's okay.
I know that.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Is it okay if I drink this?
Hello.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
There's water in your bathroom.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
Boy, you're really into this.
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Just come and get it...right here!
Where are you going???
Never heard of her.
My mother stood on this very spot.
Right.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Muh??
Well Rose was being very thorough.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed?
Maybe.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Hi!
I think this place is just fine.
I'm just tired.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
They're enormous, I know.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
It would be fantastic.
Beidermeyer?
He's a great poet.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
Arthur!!
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Of what??
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
The boss is watching us...
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
You are perfectly healthy.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
It's still available I hope?
They're dead?
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Well the other night at dinner...
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
No, why?
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Did you ahh, love him?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
VADA!
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Dad?
Dad??
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
She likes to play bingo.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
He's okay isn't he?
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
No, no no....
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
No....
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Do you like her?
Is that your camper?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
I would.
Are you married?
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Where's your bike?
No, I don't wanna.
Hmmmm, interesting.
Do you remember her?
THIS!! 
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
Jump in the water!!
Hi Vada.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
So now you'll have a mother.
I do, she's real funny.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Close your eyes.
Just do it.
You better not either.
What?
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
Blood oath.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
Elmer's Glue?
But I can't be dry.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
What else did he tell you...
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
But he sure can kiss.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
Jesus, we're trapped!
But he always says...
I never want to go through this again.
I saw the show.
Is anybody watching?
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
She's too genuine.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Waiter! Check, please!
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Takes me back.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
This thing means that much to y...
What happened?
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
This is her family and her fault.
What's up?
Lower.
Almost three.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
It's not just a gag, huh?
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
What?
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Barnett?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
What did you say your name was?
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
Yes.
She's fine.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Well, how about the shopping center?
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
He's my father.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
He is just wonderful.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
How do you know?
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Parts.
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
I feel really good.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Have your children been deaf since birth?
When did you start singing?
Do you ever do any writing?
Do you like him?
I'd really like to see you.
What?
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
What for?
Sorry I'm late.
Where's Bill?
Where are you going?
How's your stomach?
Come on.
You go to school together?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
Southern California.
Got me an audition tonight.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
You got something you want to do?
Mickey!
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
Say something.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Was what worth it?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
I could go for a Coke.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
Yeah baby.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
The entire wing?
How immediate is immediately?
Roger, no.
Who?
Are you all set?
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
It's gonna be beautiful.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Ya know, I was.
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Could we go with you and film it?
Where' you goin'?
It sure is.
Boy - you hear me?!
Want to talk to you.
I said: Cut it out!
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
Guess so.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Been over to the other mill?
Oh yeah?
Your folks live there?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Hell!
Let's go, Duff.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
That's right.
What's he like?
How did it go?
Don't push me, Duff.
What about him?
Is that so?
Everything you cook is good.
Hmmm - good coffee.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
You heard me!
Ain't you goin' to say something?
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
That's right.
See you, Duff.
'See ya.
'You Will Anderson?
I'm Duff.
No.
I asked you somethin', boy!
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
How you doin', boy?
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Seems a little loose!
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Come back some other time, will you?
Going back, huh?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Don't be too hard on him.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Now you stay put!
Got a thick feelin' here.
Omar--
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
You're hurt...
What are you doing in here?
What you lookin' for, mon?
Easy...
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
What?
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Where the hell have you been?
What about the route to the core?
Wait... You hear that?
Want to fucking answer them?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
Where did you here that?
Case... are you okay?
And we really do have to talk.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
You've been calling her name.
That's not going to help.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Case... Are you alright?
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Like what?
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Oh, man! Who told?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
No Roger from op/ed?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Who told!
Anita!
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Senorita Josie.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Bridgework?
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Wings?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
He is totally crunching on you.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Hey--what are you thinking about?
Oh.
God, I can't do this.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
I love the way she writes.
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Yoooooow.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
No, I'm alone.
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
That is so sad --
Aloha! Welcome!
By name.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
Shock.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
Where're we taking him?
Yes.
If you went away, what would become of me?
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
Where are you going?
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
You mean a shithead.
I figured you might like some help.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
What's all this.
So, you feeling anything?
I feel like a jerk.
Yeah?
It's gone now.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Hi.
Morning.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
What's that?
We're going up to bed now.
I'm serious.
I'll need to take her things.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Girl, what are you doing?
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
Max, where's Kristen?
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
Anything?
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
You're late.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
That's what I know.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Just until we get things under control.
To who?
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
C'mon.
Why is he after us?
We're here.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
No!
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
And then I... right.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Floppy, huh?
No, I didn't.
So who left who?
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Cartwright.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
How are you doing?
That's not true.
Well... how have you been?
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Excuse me.
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Does the girl have a name?
Yes.
Still loves you though.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Hello, Bernie.
Is this your first film?
Da Vinci?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
What do you think?  Good move?
I'll see what I can do.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
I agree.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Well, fire away.
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
That's right -- Topol.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Buggered?
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Cool, huh?
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
What did she say?
Yes.
Spike!
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Excuse me.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Why?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
That's it! We made it!
You men remain seated!
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
In ya go...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
In there.
They must be up there!
It's the questions she asks.
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Lobotomy!
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
I said out!
You can come back later!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Don't you have any clubs?
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
Ten bucks.
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Oh yeah...
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Hey, how ya doin'?
Yeah...
Hi.
Hit me!
Yeah!
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
There they are!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
What kind of crap is that???
Is everything all right?
At this hour?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Your grandmother?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
No, really.  What's she doing?
We found each other, didn't we?
What?
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
A very large pig.
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
You...
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
How could you do this to me?
You're limping.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
I'd really rather not say.
Mickey Spillane.
Do you want me to do it?
What?...
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
You okay?
No.  Are you're leaving?
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Been here long?
Wait.
Is everything okay?
No.
No.
What's he do?
You don't have any idea?
Is that bad?...
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
I have vacation time coming to me.
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Now what do we do?
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
I just got a dial tone--
Your brother?
You expecting somebody you know?
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
He's heeeeeerrre...
And then what, Faith?
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Why?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
Amazing...
And he is living proof.
Maybe I can change him.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
What about Larry?
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
I came after the woman I love.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
I'm gonna take her home first.
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
I wish I knew.
Working hard?
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
That's right... .
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
What the hell!!!
See! You don't understand!
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me?who?  -- who?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too?don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Terry...?
The moment I saw you.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd?get into bad company.
I'd better go in.
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Now what are you doing?
Terry!
And when things get in your way?or people 梱ou just knock them aside?get rid of Them?is that your idea?
Why, Terry, who said it was?
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Terry?what's happening to you?
Told him what?
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
My hand.
Charley.
Terry, no, no... .
Jimmy...
Every one of 'em... .
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
But you're the one I want to tell?what you said over Nolan?about keepin' silent when you know the score?I'm guilty?you hear me? I'm guilty... .
I don't get it!
About Edie?
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
Now don't give me a hard time.
Nice fellows.
So help me God!
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
I think you could have.
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
Yeah. My own blood?and they sell me out for a lousy bet?I had it in me to hit the top and? Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys?
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Better.
You was a Golden Warrior.
Give me a double.
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
I?I musta counted wrong, boss, I?
I know, Johnny, I know... .
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
You got some nerve.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
Listen?Nolan?
Leave her alone, you fiend!
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
What do you mean?
I am--It's our only chance.
That sudden?
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
...And what is this?
What kind of symbol?
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Your pleasures of course!
No. No! No!
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Yes.
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Did you know that when you married him?
I'm not dressed.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Where in the hell are we?
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
Jack?
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Let's go to Detroit.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
Outside of that.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
How long you talk to her?
How long were you with the girl?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
You talked to him?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
That's all I wanted to know.
Yeah, why?
Leave it where it is.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Who was the friend?
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
Hello?
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Where's your gun, your pistol?
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Is that right?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
I mean, romantically.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
None of your business.
That's my dad.
Unless you wanna tell me.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
Don't leave me.
You like bourbon?
You did?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
You know I saw you on the street.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
You coming back?
You're not dumb.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
I thought you guys were busted.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
The <u>ninth</u>?
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
Hi, Ray.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
That's not Maurice?
You like to sit down?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Technically.  They're separated.
No thanks.
What are you thinking about?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
You wave back?
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
You here all by yourself?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
What?
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Midge.
Foley's got it.
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
Are you sure they're here?
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
Nervous?
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
What lizard?
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Didn't you say test the limits?
How could you do this?
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
I got a half a tank.  You?
Fun today.  Like old times.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
Yeah.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Danny's not coming?
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
What else can we do?
It must of been a convincing letter.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
Let's go.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
We're going to take you home.
I'll call you Later.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Charlie really has a great voice.
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
You got a Tab?
How do you feel?
Yeah. Like that.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, let's make love.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
But what has to be different?
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Oh, Charlie.
I love you.
I thought you were...for a while.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
I beg your pardon?
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
You don't?
This is great reefer.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
I thought I knew everything about him.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Young lady, you're drunk!
For me?
Yes.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
He'll win.
Oh, you're both so naive.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell桹.
What are you doing?
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
I remember that dress.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
You look exactly the same.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
Sort of.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
What're you doing?
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life梥tyles.
Like what?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Silicon is from sand.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
What's the matter?
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
How long ago did this guy retire?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
So where're we going?
What's his name?
You want me to help?
You ever think about running away?
I know, Mom.
Mom...
What's wrong with your face?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
Thanks, you guys.
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
Don't apologize for me.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
Drew!
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
We're not skipping this treatment.
I'm not going to die.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Big trouble.
I buy that.
Thanks for your time.
Rayisha.
I'm a law suit.
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
Thanks for coming by.
Do you take risks?
Some do. I didn't.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.
Were you recently promoted?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Joe?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
He was doing a great job.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Bring the light!
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Why, what'd you hear?
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Back to the ship, huh?
They're already dead. Get on board.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Here. Make it easy on you.
Hey.
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Little ratty-ass.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
We aren't completely stupid.
Why did I fall on you?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
You mean that "load" of passengers?
One is all?
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Where's Mr. Johns?
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
SULEIMAN!
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
King Tut's tomb....
What the hell are these?
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
An' this?
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
I apologize.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Seal the cave?
The best. But we won't need them.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Do you have to work tonight?
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Look -- she remembers.
The blood transfusion.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
You didn't think so then.
How did it go?
Geiger counter?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Hmph.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Objection!
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
All right --
Can we take a dip?
Who are you?
She comes along too.
I want her.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
I told you not to bring the other one.
Who put them up?
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
What about me?
No.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Of course.
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
What is your proposal?
Sure.	In a cage.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Listen-
You want her that much?
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Would you like to come along?
He's moving his fingers!
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
I SHIT on all o' you.
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
So what's the problem?
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Yeah?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
...But what'd she do?
But what'd she actually do?
Dawn! That was it!
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
No, thanks...
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
Must be somebody?
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
You wanted to see me sir?
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
No thanks?
What's the matter?
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
The brush-off, huh?
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Want to dance?
Why not?
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
In a way.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Would I want to?
Yes, Miss.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
What this?
Where's you get it?
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
Name it.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
Got it on you?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
The only answer I have for you.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
What do I get for it?
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
You can find out.
No suicide.
What about me?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
I told you she's just..
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
To Ann.
Thank you.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Terrific.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Congratulations.  Who with?
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
Good.
Can I give you a lift?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
You don't trust me.
Did she talk about me?
And the Argies.
Now, top secret file.
What have you been up to?
Perhaps I will, then.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Hello.
Thanks.
Don't point it at James!
What's their program?
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
I can't do this.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Why should I?
Wild ride, huh?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
I know where they're going.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Nice place.
Look at you.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
Mean anything to you?
What story did you give to Davis?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
That's over the border, General.
What have you got in mind, General.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
No, you look like a hooker.
That's ridiculous.
Nice car.  Yours?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
What's your name?
What's your name, lover.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
It's a very good year.
Try a strawberry.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
I think you'll approve.
Hello?
You're upset, huh?
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
Was someone rude to you?
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
But don't they have it in English?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
I've never treated you like a whore.
What did you do to him?
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
I got tired of hating my father.
I didn't think so.
What's up, where you going?
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Love this car!  Is it new?
Edward, did you hear me?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Why do you want to know?
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
I don't think there's any sense in --
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
'Lo.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
Yeah.
Kit...
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Want a pair of boots?
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
May I help you?
Would you like to try it on?
Yes?
Having a good time, Vivian?
What?
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
Rest, Highness.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Can you move at all?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Faster!
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
I don't think more than ten.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Inigo.
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
-hold it, hold it-
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Now?
What? What?
Sir. Sir.
We're really in a terrible rush.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
We'll wait until you're ready.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
You're amazing!
Making sure nobody's following us.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
Go in, get after her!
I want to duel him left-handed.
Let me explain-
Inhale this, but do not touch.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
You're just stalling now.
Then make your choice.
You guessed wrong.
Bye-bye, boys.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
Good, what is it?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
What scheme?
You're going to jump on me.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
To failure!
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Max, I...
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
You, Blum go Motel.
Finder's keepers.
Feeling better?
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Like clockwork.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
I solemnly swear...
Of Siegfried...
The Blue Max...
People can hear you.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
You out to buy a motel?
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
What?
I live there. Alone.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
Forty thousand dollars.
Please!
I was getting to that!
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
You want me to stay here?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Arbogast said...
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
In a hurry.
Our Deputy sleeps.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
Huh?
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
For what?
Am I that close to Fairvale?
You're very... kind.
You go out... with friends?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
Phoenix?
Is anything wrong?
Is there?
We have a problem.
Mary is Lila's sister?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Recluse. Kinder word.
Barefaced.
It isn't necessary.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
You mean he doesn't work for you?
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
But where do the rats come in?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Take me down there.
What are you going to do?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
You're losing your blood?
What were you dreaming about?
That spoke to you?
Did you hear?
The child!
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
What are you laughing at?
Did you? Where?
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
There's no hurry. It's early.
Why didn't you eat last night?
Why, certainly, sir. My fianc閑. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
That's the way I feel about it.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
What! What are you talking about?
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
That's what I said.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Fine, thanks.
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
That's what I said.
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
She is the soul of that statue.
Could you?
A place you've never been.
Why am I doing this?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
'Course it does.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
You better quit that.
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Neither do I.
Yeah, I know.
The new girl is here.
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
What'd you say, Brother?
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
Yeah.
There goes Mother.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
She's putting the titty back.
So am I.
What's happening?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Is her husband sick or something?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
She hasn't actually done anything...
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Rose, what are you doing up?
You're so sweet.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
You don't know where you're going?
Is this ill right?
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Took your time gettin' here.
What's the matter with him?
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I was going to tell him.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
And... ?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
No offices are gonna be open today.
What's the plan?
The booze.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
Happy Independence Day.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
You live like a pig.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
Alright?
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
I'm gonna get beside him.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
Why the beach?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
You see that?
This shit was Ming.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Han!
Vader's on that ship.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Shall we try and go around?
Yes.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
Proper?!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
What do you remember?
Tell me.
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Yes. It's you Leia.
Then you know why I have to face him.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Yoda, I must know.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Janet.
Yes.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
I'm coming with you.
Oh....Say something.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Hello.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Promise you won't tell Brad.
What guy
Feeling
Dealing
Oh, no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Are you - giving a party?
Who's Eddie?
...How's the turtle food this week?
It's Thanksgiving.
Looks quiet, y'know.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
I would say you're very shy by nature.
Why?
It's only temporary.
It's okay.
...T-thank you.
...What?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Don't you open them anymore?
What did you say about a pet shop?
No... I can't!
...Like you?
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
How was the flight, Champ?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Did ya get the license number?
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Kiss my ass.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Nine minutes!
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
What's ya name again?
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
I'm sure you are.
Make your teeth yella --
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
...Who'd ya fight?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
God bless ya, Rock.
Ya nose is broke.
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
Yo, Paulie.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
...Maybe I better forget it.
...I can't haul meat no more.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
So altruistic.
Where is he?
Hold on a second.
What's with the dip?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
Valiant!  You surprised me.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Keep reading...
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Romeo! Romeo!
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Farewell, my cuz.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
'Tis he.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Why, may one ask?
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
Nurse.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Do you have it?
Why did you do that?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
Well I don't!
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
From Interpol?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
I better be getting that.
Are you alright?
It's quite satifactory.
I'd stake my reputation.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Do you have it?
He's company.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Whoever hired us.
Bullshit!
Then where is it?
Is it done?
He's tough, your American friend.
American.
Yeah.
So what is it you want to know?
Created?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
Long enough to shoot back.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
They call me Swede.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Cigarette?
Something like that...
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
It was at that.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
He's going back.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
Alright, it's done.
You know him?
The Irish representative?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
They don't have the package.
Give me a cigarette.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
Do we need anything else?
Not here.  They might see it.
Because I don't walk away.
Let's get him out of here...
And now...
You speak French.
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Gaelic.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
My man, how you doing?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
No.  We can't.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
It won't work.
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
I've got one condition.
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
Shhh!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I don't know...
Okay then.  I'll do it.
It's the right thing to do.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
He would have done it to us, right?
He's going to be trouble.
Not bad enough to kill him.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
Do you have everything?
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
And you're solid on that?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Yeah?  So?
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Yeah.
Yeah I'm fine.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
What?
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Shopping here?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I抦 a busy man.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Something wrong, Jesse?
What's this?
Hey where's the hot pad?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
It was going to be a surprise!
What are you saying?
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
Don't hurt me.
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
Well I don't know --
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
You think he skipped town?
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Invitation, please.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Oh, you American?
You bring American money?
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
What'd I say?
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
What are you doing?
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
Who?
How do you know he's our man?
It's a long story.
Is it hot in here?
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
I don't understand?
Wait!  There's people down there!
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
Are you okay?
I'm not used to having a partner.
See you in the next world.
What's a Chinese heaven?
I think we should stop talking.
Let's go.
What is Mac out?
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
No you didn't!
We made it, man.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
A little Mu-shu.
Is this a payoff?
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
What is your name?
He stole my wheel!
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
Help me Rhonda.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
What about them?
The license!  You get it?!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
You talk too fast.
No, please, I don't --
I'm sorry, Lee.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
How'd what go?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
You don't like it?
How much they want?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
You a cop or something?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
Hello.
I would like one of my people to help.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
Yes.
You look awful.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Thanks.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
What?
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
No.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Kind of isolated.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
I'm okay with that.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Ya think?
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
I'm really rooting for this one.
What?
No, no.  You're her best friend.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
But it's on the water.
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
I do.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
Oh!
You should write something about this.
Right.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
He lost all the weight... there.
Yes.
But he saw you, right?
It's a sign --
What about the letter?
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Howard.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
You know.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Sure you do.
Which means --
Hello.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
Who is this?
It's been about a year and a half.
What was it that made you know?
Is he home right now?
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
No.
Dad, could you close the door?
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Eighty dollars.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
Do you want a fruit plate?
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Somewhere in the middle.
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
This is a good letter, Dad.
Dad!
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Jonah!
Don't ever do that again.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Did too.
What about camping?
Do you like it?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
It's a little derivative.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
I thought you were never going to call me.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
Oh.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
You haven't tried locking them up!
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
What's the matter?
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
How do you feel?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
You know I don't think that.
Well, if that's possible ...
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
Forgot what?
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Are you Australian?
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
What?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
What is it?
Ride 'em cowboy)
Yeah.
Oh God.
What?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Is that how you play?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
We been through that.
I need my paycheck.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
What's wrong, Danny?
Really, I don't want to.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
Don't get carried away.
You want a hit?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
You don't trust me?
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
By not disgracing her memory!
Can we talk price?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
You're serious?
But I just met you.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
You want to do this some other time?
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
You think I'm a Judas?
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
I was trying to score some dope.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
I thought you'd be happy.
Danny?
Please ... don't do this ...
This the guy?
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
Turns out he's connected.
When is the deal going down?
Nervous?
You mean like the Donner Party?
You think that's a good idea?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Find a chaplain.
Resistance?
Casualties?
A private, sir?
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
Yep.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
Upham?
Some.
Over three-hundred.
The men said, nine.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
What'd you say, Captain?
GO!
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Oh, yeah?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
What do you think?
Captain, can I ask you a question?
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
Maybe Caen.
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
I'd like to go, sir.
You set?  Sarge nods.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
How do you do it?
You think he really believed it?
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
That's not even a scam.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
I don't feel anything.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
Ha!
What are you doing?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I'm sorry.
I won?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Morning honey.
Goodnight.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
Morning.
You should be.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Do you love him?
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
What happened to you?
You think you know what this money is?
Mom, please?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Busy?
Actually, I think that I...
I'll go.
Thank-you.
It's just you and your dad, right?
So what's your job this summer?
I think you should wear that.
It's okay, everybody does that.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Are you comfortable?
No.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
It did?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
Is this because of your dad?
Did you tell anybody?
It's your castle, man.
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
My car.
Lloyd.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Ooop, excuse me.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Certainly.
I love you man
What?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
We started without you.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
You took my workers.
What's wrong with it?
Oskar, good of you to come.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Don't ever do that to me again.
I'll talk to him.
Four hundred, four fifty -
Eight hundred, give or take.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
What if I said goodbye?
I thought you were going to the mixer?
It helped me realize one thing.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Fair enough.
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Jesus, you抮e just as whacked as your son.
But you抣l never get away with it.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
About what?
Lemme take you home.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Hello, Dwight.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
You have every right to be upset.
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
Yeah?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
And it's sexier in the dark.
Ssshh! What was that?
Let's go.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
Oh my God. How could it happen?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Who is this?
Where are you?
What do you want from me?
I'm sorry.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
What?
I have rehearsal.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
Can I come with her?
Oh, Sid, you抮e sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
The young girl is slashed again.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
I hate scary movies.
Take it off.
What was that?
Do you work for her now?
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Yeah.
Can I help you?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
Are you sure?
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
Hmm.
Detective Kincaid?
I can see nothing's changed.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Yeah?
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
They found another note?
Why would the police come to you?
What about me?
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Off the record.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Thank you.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Who's phone?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Geez.
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
No really?
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Just because you knew her?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Are you saying she was-
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
What'd he say?
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Hello.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
You're dead!
Dude. What are you doing here?
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
You rode your bike out there?
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Billy? What the...
What are you doing here?
My dad's in the other room.
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
You know what my dad will do to you?
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Oh Billy... Please... God...
Jesus, SHIT!
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
I wanna let go. I do...
You heard me.
Who did you call?
I thought you were...
Hello?
Yes.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
No.
What do you want?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I wanna play a game.
...please...
You tricked me...
...leave me alone... please...
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
So is Dewey your real name?
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
Did you reach my Dad?
At the airport.
I don't know. I guess.
Have they found my father?
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
I'll look for it.
Off the record. No cameras.
You owe my mother.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
You're evil.
I have no idea.
Hello?
I heard screaming.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't come any closer.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
You coming tonight?
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Take a message.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
How's that?
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Have you heard?
Already.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
What?  What?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
I don't believe it.
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
You didn't know.
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
I... I don't follow.
Not here.
Drop it.
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
Well?
How's that?
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
Did you read them?
No witnesses of any kind?
You're sure your men didn't move this?
What?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
How did the fire fight end?
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
We don't know for sure...
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
What are you going to say?
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
He's preaching.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
No.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
Let's get along...
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
You all right, sergeant?
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
I've come now...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
I think maybe we oughta...
Stay out here.
They'll be back...
What's that got to do with us?
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
She'd be about thirteen now...
Why else?
Ellen, move aside...
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Hey... the fuse.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
I miss Tommi so much.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
What?
She was old.
Maybe an animal.
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
What?
How did you get me out of there?
No, I've never seen him before.
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
Mrs. Straub!
What?
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Ned匢 know匢 know
Oh
Oh厀hat have I done?
Follow that boat!
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
What do you want, Kit?
What is the chief part?
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Most interesting.
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
It's a comedy.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
There's never any
Is it going well?
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
What happened to Sam?
Do you know it?
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
God be praised!  Locked?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Nobody. The author.
How will it?
What is the story?
Good luck with yours, Kit.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
What do you love so much?
Your Majesty
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Oh but why "alas?"
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Moonlight!
Oh, do not go
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Will you read it for me?
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
But all ends well.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Your name?
Take off your hat.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Your aunt?
Like a sickness and its cure together.
And her lips?
"Poet?"
How do I offend, my lord?
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
In the same fashion as chess.
What do you think?
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You think so?
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
No, not that.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
That was good.
What's the problem?
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
How much?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
What? Yes, that's fine.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
What?
I've never seen any of these men before.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Yes.
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
Did you know --
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
Who was it?
I think you're lying.
What sort of car?
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
Now?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Who's going to do it?
Be careful.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Hello. Hello.
Leave him alone.
We have to talk.
We could put it somewhere.
I refuse.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
You mustn't take it so badly.
It's OK. There's no problem.
It's about the burglary.
Downstairs.
Yes.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Just get on with it, Alex.
Are you all right?
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Two hundred pounds.
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
Who have you talked to?
So let's go.
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
Hello.
What guy that died?
You must be Hugo.
It's nice.
I see.
Do you think you could answer that?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
For what?
The human condition.
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
Same as everyone else.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
I don't know, I think...
Don't you like her?
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
What?
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
What're you looking for?
She's got a...
I know.
You're late, George.
I don't want to talk about it...
Nummers.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
What're you doing later?
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Your husband?
I know.
That headboard.
Like what?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Shit.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
No kidding.
Yeah.
That you're just like your mother.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
You do it.
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
Well, what do you think?
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
It was after you, baby. After you.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
Baby...
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
What are you looking at?
-- very nice, very nice.
-- good afternoon --
Look about last night --
You're going to kill me.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
Oh yeah?
What with?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
I have to see you.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
You're great.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I don't want to fight, George.
Well that's something.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
-- and take this with you.
-- please, baby --
I wish you'd go now.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
No.
It's good you want to do something, George.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
I know it, I know it.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
All night.
Sit down.
I wanna hear about it, George.
Want a drink?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
She's nothing but a whore.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
All right, who're you with? Jill?

No you won't.

The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
Shut the door, shut the door!
They get hair all over the place.
Here.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
We don't think marriage is important.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
How much?
It's been so long I don't how long?
I would say so, yes.
Egypt?
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
-- why?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
-- I'll get in the back --
Are you married?
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Everything okay, son?
Dad?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Chocolate.
Who's Tony?
Maybe he showed me something.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Yeah.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
I won't make any noise.
Mommy... Mommy...!
Mommy!
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Shall we go into the living room?
It's okay, really.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
Delbert Grady.
How?
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
No charge?
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
I don't know.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
Yes...
Of course I am.
Stay away from me!
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Jack, stay away from me!
Give me the bat.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
Well, obviously some people can be
I'd better collect my family first.
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Can I tell you kids something?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Went shopping. Why?
You booger.
Your mom's not around, is she?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
Yeah? Really?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
But how?
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
You bastard!
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
This prom is a real drag.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
What?
Shirelles.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
It'll be hell.
Hopeless I
Is there any syrup?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
We need experience.
I'm getting experience.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Mary Clarence!
I don't want to mess anyone up...
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
The vow of obedience.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
You saved my life.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
Ten flights?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
No nothing.
I hate you.  I totally hate you.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
What'd she say?
I am?
You're not... seeing anybody?
I can't go with you.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
Where's who?
But you didn't tell me!
It's done?
Get her!
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
Is this like your old convent?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Not a note.
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
We must be a curious sight to him.
He is a behemoth.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
It is sacrilege!
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Maybe you should take this.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
What is that you wear?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
I manage fine alone.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
Out there.  What do you see?
Thank you.
We are leaving.
Did your father take a loan?
What books?
Why... why are you like this?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Thank you.  No.  Here...
And this gives worth to butchery?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
I have not been able to face him yet.
What was that?
Returning to the Western Woods?
Use caution.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Can you help?
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
I don't reckon.
Thank ye.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
You know what, by God?
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
What's in your bag?
You believe in the Bible?
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
But maybe just for awhile --
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
Were they bad people?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
What do you mean?
Why?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
A blister shore can hurt.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Karl, you up?
Do they know about you?
You scared me.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Thank ye.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
We sure like havin' you.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Will he be supervised?
Yes.
What!
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Like me, too.
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
And your father? Is he from New York?
What'll it be, Auggie?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
A photographer ...
I've never seen anything like it.
Slow down, huh?
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
So. Are we ready?
Did you ever go back to see her?
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
Like what?
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
Lovely.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
It's for you.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Does it hurt?
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
I figured he had a right to know.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
Benefits?
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Well, if you put it that way...
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
Here and there. Around.
Yeah, that's right.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Two or three nights.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Where the hell do you think you're going?
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Thanks. 
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
And started to run.
Well?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
Lettuce and tomato?
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
Well, what then, sergeant?
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
You said three minutes.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
That's when he fell.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
What makes you think I play?
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Improved...how?
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Wanna see my driver's license?
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
But suppose he loses?
Right.  We have the same blood type...
Nellie told us about it.
You mean it's a girls' band?
You've flipped your wig!
Where are we running, Joe?
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
My name is Josephine.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
How can we?  We're broke.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
And where's he going to be?
What happened?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
Joe -
Not that, you idiot.
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
We'll take a rain check.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
And your head is hot.
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
You all right?
Who needs vermouth?
Here you are, Sugar.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Thirty-four.
Where did you girls play before?
How did those holes get there?
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
Because I got some plans -
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Put it here.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
What's happened?
Want to switch berths with me?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?
Are you staying at the hotel?
Your face is familiar.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Shell Oil?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
The most wonderful thing happened -
Guess!
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Been waiting long?
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Oh - in here.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Where's your shell collection?
What's on Thursdays?
You mean we're alone on the boat?
What thing?
See?  Nothing.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
Would you do me a favor?
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
I think you're on the right track.
I never knew it could be like this.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Daphne -
You'll forget him, Sugar.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
You shave with your spats on?
And who runs it?
Refresh my memory.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You know what I love about all this?
Christ, Amy.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
If Ed ever found out....
Where抯 Nick sleeping?
Huh?
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
What抯 going on with you two?
There抯 a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
I抣l just check into a hotel.
And Kat was fully clothed.
I didn抰 deserve her back then.
Nothing, nothing.
Hey, man.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we抮e the past. I抦 not sure if you noticed, but I抦 here with someone else.
It抯 called character. God, you抮e predictable.
Hi. Hey.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram?
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don抰 think he wants me back?
What does your gut say?
Who are they?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Not the way you抮e thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
Are you asking me if I抦 gay for pay?
I love that you抮e asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
Don抰 stop asking questions, okay?
Subtle?
It抯 hard to explain.
Are you sure?
So you抮e telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That抯 a down payment on a Ford Focus!
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It抯 all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you抮e not walking away!
Nice speech. I thought it was 搕ouching?.. and 揻unny.?
Like fifteen.
You want me to let him in?
揘ot yet...?
I抦 guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
I am now, sir.
What is it you do again?
What do you say to that?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
That does it...
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
What about Sounder?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
And so you did your job, right?
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
No buts, Rita!
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
You learnin' anything at that school?
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Mornin', son...
You hurt, Daddy!?
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
'Bye, Mama...
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Is he gon' be gone long?
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
Where you goin'!?
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
What... are you?
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
What?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
Hey Cartman.
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
The N word?
You bastards.
Look at that!
Hello there, children!!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Who are you, kid?
May I?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Ber dada!
Mrph?
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
What's that?
No... The General is right.
SHIT!
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
It's so very cold...
It's okay, I am done for.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Nowhere.
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
This is sweet!!
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
And Bill?
I'm needing lunch.
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
We must take action on this immediately.
How is the children's progress?
You'd fuck your uncle!
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
AGH!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
My friend the clitoris told me.
Got it.
Getting drunk is no solution.
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Anna...
Jesus, come on!
Evening.
Oh, thank you.
So...
Were you going to give it to them?
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
I think I can handle it.
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Break it down to me, what's going on?
It's time we lock coordinates.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
He certainly is polite.
Yeah.  We did it.
You're ready for the real thing?
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Explosive?
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
Take this flare.
And what are you going to do?!
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
Sooner than later.
In that case, I accept.
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
Thank you.
No, just enjoying the view.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
Where's Taylor?
I'm homesick.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Sorry about your loss.
- canker sore.
How do you turn this thing off?
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Buzz Fazeli.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
What about bowling?
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
I don't like to talk about it.
What did you do to Buzz?
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Where's Junior?
After we eat, Dad.
Like this?
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
I'm a bowler.
Get that outta your mouth!
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Uh...over easy.
Business.
This is a vicious cycle.
Where did your brother escape from?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
What's plan B?
Come on, bargain with me.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
He's dead Sheila.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Very good, busyboy.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Wait a minute --
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Then why am I here?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
They pressurize us with helium.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Wait a second --
You don't think weapons are important?
What for?
I see it.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
You don't know that.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
I'd also like it noted --
Look at this.
Some sort of lead or something.
What's wrong?
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
Did you hear me, sir, because --
They switched us over.
Edmunds?
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Resetting the sub.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Wait a minute.
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Beth --
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
You fixed my suit?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
None of this was here before.
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
What is it, Norman?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
You know what I mean.
Did you?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
You manifested that, Beth.
You're insane.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
Beth!
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth, stop it!
Stop it!
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
For who?  The fish?
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
Why are you looking at me like that?
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
No.  I didn't say that.
... you there?  Norman?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Push her, c'mon.
Gimme a second --
Her legs are in the way.
You know how to work this thing?
How's that working out, by the way?
What'd you say to him?
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
Do you?
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
How are the others?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
What report?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
No, not anymore.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
What's wrong?  What's happening?
The Kiber Crystal.
Of course, where you been kid?
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
See Threepio... do you copy?
Are you safe?
You rich kids... are all the same !
Mobile Infantery rules !
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
How do you make him do that ?
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Are you alright ?
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
So ?
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
You can't walk me home.
Isn't it great to be in love ?
None at all... We won.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
You talk to Carl ?
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
What happened to your hair ?
What's wrong with you ?
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Are your parents currently citizens ?
What is your position ?
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
Our data is being prepared.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
One hundred kilometers...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
We're losing the pattern...!
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
They had a pattern to follow...
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Cal...
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
The people in New Hampshire.
You haven't heard of it.
You like my play.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...

But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
Fix my glasses.
Great.  Who is it...?
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
It's for your finger.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Why?
What's the scene...
What've you got?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
...yes.
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
Press still works.
Lookit that, up already.
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
Ten thousand dollars.
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
I've been thinking.
I'm sorry.
He works on the movie.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
Mornin', Doc...
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Bobby, don't say anything.
The prices are going up.
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
Nice town that you've got here.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Tell it with...
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
You do...?
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
Aren't you ever in school?
What's his name?
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
No.
I want you to hear this.
I love Jewish men.
But not that <u>way</u>...
That's my...
Will you help me out...?
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
...I know...I know...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
...wants a piece...
And you know what...?
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Did she throw up?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Hi.
I'm looking for the writer.
He saw the accident...?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I...
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
Not now.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I know the feeling.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
I've got a date.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
I don't getcha.
What did you say to them...?
How do you know you saw it?
I...
It's lovely.
Did you bring Bob's weights?
What's in all the bags?
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
Yeah?
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
You hear that?
...the damn thing...
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
How would you know sh...
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
And don't tell her I told you.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
Actually.  I could only help him.
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Great.  Big ears, too?
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You touched it.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
Excuse me --
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Poof!  You're happy now.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
That I do.  Always will.
Where Ben?
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
So we'll...radiate some more?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Rachel's not half my age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Me too.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
We...
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
We don't have any coffee.
Get out!
Machines do not EAT message.
However many.  It's not enough.
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
I don't know wh...
My boss.
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
She hasn't mentioned this.
Can I look at the pictures?
So.  Hopeful.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
And I'm going to win.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
But?  But what?
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
It's forever you know.
It's just an assignment.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
I told her I loved her.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Don't ever say that.
Out! Leave the table!
Marty, ignore him.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Really? How many?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
You have a bay?
Oh. How did it happen?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
So whaddya think?
No, you don't.
This is definitely better.
Don't even joke about that!
Mom?
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Reconceive.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a卆 speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
I dunno.
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
You're welcome.  Dad?匴ould you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Come here, give me a hug!
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
That's good.
You have beautiful skin.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
...gger.
Fuck me hard!
No, not really.
I hate reading.
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
Anything I might know about?
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
How'd you get it?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
You know...I like you.
So like, yeah匢 caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like 卻till really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews匶'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Prnceton.
Can I see what you have so far?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
I said I'll lead.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
Now what?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
Good.
What about Cooper--where is he?
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Agreed--let's move it.
Drop the anchor!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
Possibly some coffee?
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Where are you trying to reach him?
Yes?
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Yes!
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Why do you think I ask?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
That is correct, Major.
Suppose that were the case?
I'm trying to, sir.
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
And you'd like to see that?
Do you think they would cheat?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
How long will it take to receive them all?
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
What else could it be?
Maximum ECM.
Check.
Check.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Primary arming switch.
So am I.
Where'd they get you?
Primary circuit is live.
Second safety.
What happened?
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
I'm okay.  What's up?
Maybe the warning system's out.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
Can I have some?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
That was really great.
Uh-huh.
Hey!
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Jesus Christ.
Go!
Fuck it!
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
Hey, you know me.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
What?
Yeah.
Great.
So, then, you're, like, available?
Yes! Free concert!
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
You better! Yes!
He paid you man.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
Whoa!
You could do it.
Yeah!
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
A Porsche.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
Deep down. Way down.
I know. It's okay.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Uh-huh.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
I don't know.
Jeff, stay there.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Why we're just standing here.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Please?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Was that supposed to be me?
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
This is ridiculous!
Jeff. Jeff.
What?
So what do you wanna do?
New ground?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Wait, away?
To his hotel?
Do your covers and all that shit.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Sorry.
Great.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Is that your driver?
So? What's L.A. like?
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Yeah?
You're not serious.
Would I get paid?
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
Me?
What the fuck are you talking about?!
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Yeah?
Just one?
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
I'm going out later.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Holy shit.
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Hello?
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Hi, Jack.
I know, but that was before.
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Yeah?
Yeah?
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
You want us to help you pick up?
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
Really...
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
You sure you wanna go there?
My best friend got pregnant.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Give me your coat.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Hurt feelings department.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
Check.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
May I say you smell real special.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
Hello, Betty.
You bet.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Gordon Cole?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
We've missed you too, dear.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Are you or aren't you?
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
Keep it.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
How did it go?
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
Wanted what?
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
Uh-huh?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Joseph C. Gillis?
Got a title?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Haven't got a thing.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
Paramount is calling.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
What is the scene? Where am I?
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
A Storm Dragon?
At last. Ultimate Power.
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
Western Europe.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
You're not afraid are you?
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
Someone's chasing him.
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
What are you making:
What's a tree?
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
I'd rather not talk about it.
How'd you do that?
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Lucy; come back!
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
Who are you ?
I was on Earth...
That horrible woman!
You're going to take me back?
You can use the wand.
Goodbye...
What?
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
You know what's the problem?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
I can never get a way from it.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
A television set?
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
How do you do that?
What?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
Is this whitemail?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
You want to mess with Superman?
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
What terrific story?
Lots of things...
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
It could make weather!
Computers talk to other computers, right?
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
Yes! This time we got it right!
Jimmy, how's the -
Are you okay?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Lois, what are you doing?
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Oh Clark, no!
I was right. you are Superman.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
I didn't think I wanted to.
I want to.
Let's go to my place.
You do?
What??
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
Genius!  --  Lex.
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
DELETE IN CUTTING
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
Superman! The --
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
You're late. Very late.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Awesome!
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
What's he going to say?
Where's Clark?
Whoa. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
I'm not going anywhere.
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
Me?
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Mother...
Not...gray.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Hey!
What now, my love?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
Is that what they're calling him?
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Listen...thank you.
Besides that.
Oh.
You and your real estate.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
I'm going to bed.
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Ready?
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
You got wax in your ears?
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
What're you writing, Lois?
It's a ...baby.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Where do you hail from?
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
Which one?
What...does it turn to?
Say hi to Zoe.
I can help you.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Have you been waiting long?
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
About the Ottos?
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
You've talked to Billy?
That's what he said, is it?
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
Away from your crazy Mom.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
Nicole?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
Dolores.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Do you have the blood test?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Oh God, I'm scared.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
Yes.
Dolores?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Yes.
Yes.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
I was scared.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
What do you remember about the accident?
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
She'll move away.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
But of course...
He's somewhere...
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
You told him that?
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
How?
And who's feet is she on now?
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
And where was his wife?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
But...
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
Who else phoned?
If that's for me, tear it up!
Why me...?
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
I didn't do anything!
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
I made you write a beautiful song...
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
Please... let... the kids... go...
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Where we going?
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Why do you cry?
I'll deal with the police.
We don't have much time.
Will it melt in there?
It must end here... or I am the future.
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Out of the way, John!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
Ready to rock?
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
I have detailed files.
The CPU from the first terminator.
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
On Furtw鋘gler.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
I'm very sorry.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
What's that mean?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Think you can get me any of that?
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
Major, Major... he's here ...
I can't do this. It's not right.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
I made no deal!
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Tough, tough!
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
What did Goering say?
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
Then you are wrong.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Yes, I know who he is.
That's an outrageous lie!
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
How can I know such a thing?
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
It's Dr. Furtw鋘gler's baton, which I stole.
Yes, you remember.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Dr. Furtw鋘gler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Aren't I worth waiting for?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
Anything else?
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
You must have a girlfriend.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
You cold?
Thanks a lot.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Not possible.
And so you feel nothing.
I don't think I like this.
And who was the enemy?
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Give me the short version.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
What?
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
Clean out your locker.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
Oh, God... !
This can't be real...
There's got to be a flashlight.
Don't even think about it.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
I'll give you a boost.
There's a ladder here.
You're the one who started running.
Where are we going?
Nice.
Want anything to drink?
Take the picture out.
No!  I'm sick of this...
What are you doing... ?
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
Who are "they?"
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
I don't know.  A lot.
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
What the fuck are you... ?
Guess you missed it.
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
Nicholas...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Don't move, you bitch... !
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
I redecorated.  What about you?
Tell me you'll call.
But, will you?
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
It doesn't matter...
Do it for YOU.
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
Yes.
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
I'll explain someday.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
May I make two suggestions... ?
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
I've been so lonely.
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
What's this about?
I don't like her.
I wasn't expecting you.
Attractive...
What's happened...
Nicholas...
How concerned should I be?
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Just what I told you.
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.
Luke, can I talk to you?
Nell --
Was sure she'd be in here.
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
Nell!  What's wrong?
What happened after you smelled it?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
Someone is playing with you.
I don't know.
Come on.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
What do you want?
Yes.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
What did it cost?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
No.
Jeez.
Why?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
Am I a thing?
I'm not.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
What's the matter?
No.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Man knows what he likes.
Who done it, then?
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Huh?
What?
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
Steady on.
Too easy?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Had a feeling it was you.
What was that, then?
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
When did you get in?
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
Are you serious.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
Tell us about it.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
Overnight.  What about just now?
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
I guess you're just habitual.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Fancy it?
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Don't you work with Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Hey.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
Is Valentine here?
Where is he, then?
I miss my kids.
You've made it ... brighter.
Is he here?
Yes?
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Hi, Mr Crane.
Hello, Mr Crane.
Yeah.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
Ah yes, a music lover.
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
...Were you in the service, Ed?
How much to they want, Dave?
...You know... who *who* is?
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
...What a knucklehead.
...What's so damn strange about that?
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
Not guilty, your honor...
No thanks.
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
That was quite something.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
...You sure, Eddie?
Frank.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
You don't got a headache?
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
'Lo, Ed.
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
Second chair.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
His eyes are open.
I'll go down and speak to him.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Yes.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
What happened to them?
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
How big is the sub-basement?
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Dr. Green has to see you!
What's that?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
What are we talking about here?
Curious.  There's something missing.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
What is it?
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Like the claw.
What's going on?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
How many storage areas are there?
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Something tried to get into this room!
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
What do you do?
Not that big.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
Genetic damage?
You're not.  Where is it?
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
What is it doing?
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
We're not going to make the storage room!
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
Where exactly?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
You want to book the flight?
Why is he in the basement?
We're not watching the sea.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
Who are you?
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
Nothing was real.
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
Well, what do you want to do?
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
What're we doing here, Truman?
Stay where you are!
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Well, what do you think?
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
What did you want?
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
Arrah!
What do I do?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
--we need more charcoal.
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
It looks so small.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
You got it.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
What is it you find incredible?
How can this be?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
How's that?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
How'd you find me?
He just let it explode.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
I'll know soon enough.
Negotiating with whom?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
How can I reach you?
You've been using me --
You didn't know my father --
Mulder -- it's me --
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
You're... quitting?
Are you drunk, Mulder?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
It's like jelly.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Why are you whispering?
This looks like new grass to you?
Where would they be going?
You think they went left?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
You hear that?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
We're going to the morgue.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Are we being watched?
Mr. Mulder.
Where's Scully?
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
What is it?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
Where is he?
My god...
Sing a song of sixpence...
Did we go sailing?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Damn him.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
Why'd you bring him here?
What about Julia?
Wait...
I heard Julia and John got married.
He's mine?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Intravenous administration complete.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Into Stargher.  Inside...
You're looking well.
So?
I need it.
How is she?
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Thank you.
You were awfully good.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
...at all.
Why?
Harry?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Can I hear you?
When...what did you do?
...to steal my girl.
Oh, that was many years ago.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
What happened to your hand?
Have you seen Calloway?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
...is there?
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Oh, well.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
...parents.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
That's the reason.
He works in a military hospital.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
They are - private - letters.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Where?
Him dying like that.
...to him.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
It wouldn't work.
Didn't I?
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
It's a military hotel.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Do you know his number?
You do!
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Seems exciting.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Hello, Harry.
I want to talk to you.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Did the police believe you?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
Do you expect me to give myself up?
You told them, didn't you?
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
...this way.
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Martins.
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Speak English?
Excuse me!
...Popescu...
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Could he have been conscious?
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
...this time.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
Bonjour.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Bonsoir.
Francoise -
Too far?
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
What, do you like it here?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
I'm coming to your room tonight.
Where'd you get this?
How come there's no punctuation?
I want to learn to read it.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
It looks a little like a swastika.
No, I think you shouldn't.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Why are you taking that?
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
An investment banking house.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I don't do that.
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Balint?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
How have things been going?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Tell it to Hitler.
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Which was his room?
Get out of here....
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
That's all we've got left.
It's not going to be fine. It's --
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
You missed on purpose.
Where do you think you're going?
Leary?
Adam Sandler.
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Did the driver really freeze?
What's happened??
No!
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
The Mamma's there too.
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
Checking out the competition.
Dollars.
And... does the voice come back?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
Your mother?
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
Here...  Here...
You still collect them?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
Don't you have a heater?
A drink to warm up?
Tea... or whiskey?
Please, have a seat.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
Jacques, you set a world record.
I'm going back home.
Then, tell me a story.
I'm being a pain, huh?
You sure?
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
Promise me one thing.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
... And the new stereo.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
... And those?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Wait!  Professor...?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
There won't be any need for that sir.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Want to get a drink?
What was that!?
What!?
I want you to talk dirty to me.
So don't show a picture.
Anything else?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
What's wrong with him?
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
How do we bypass it?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
What should I charge?
I wasn't too over the top?
Get off of me you cripple!
What day is it?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Is he in love with you?
I want him to lock me up.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
He will be waiting...
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 棗
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Come to look around?
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
Some crazy guy.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
To the eye? Like other men.
It was you, Galbraith!
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Yes. The lipstick.
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so 棗
That's a fact, isn't it?
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Are you all right?
Suppose I slip them a few bucks ?for the funeral expenses.
Who was the other man?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft梥oap twenty editors!
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
棗	As long as my feet held out.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
It's a lovely town ? it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Good afternoon. De Moraes抯 residence.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn抰 here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over ?,000 to get rid of him.
I won抰 comment on the time but you抣l understand if I don抰 tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
It抯 a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I抦 told it retails at around ?,000.  I see you don抰 require a definition.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don抰 mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he抯 either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I抳e seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I抦 here at such a late hour. I need ?0,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
No. The question now is how long it抯 going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
I still don抰 buy your story but I figured it can抰 do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
You lost my money?
Are you all right?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I抣l give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Mr Lombard...
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can抰 satisfy him?
You know he抎 have had him killed, don抰 you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
What do you mean, 慛o? Mrs De Moraes?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He抯 a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You抎 have been ready for me when I turned up with 慡leeping Beauty? Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. 揘ot Leon,?you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn抰 say 慚y God!? or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. 揘ot Leon.?Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I抎 stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at ?5,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn抰 you?
Is there anything to understand?
Five years of it. Surely, you抎 have divorced him if he disgusted you?
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Don抰 you believe in simplicity?
You know something? I抳e just seen so much ugliness I don抰 think I抎 mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I抎 hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that抯 the way you want it.
Do you think we抎 let him get away with the murder of my brother?
What do you suggest?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
You抮e sure you won抰 sit down, Miss Stewart?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
Get a pen and don抰 ask any questions.
What...?
Then find another way.
...I抦 Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that抯 who I am. Do you get what I抦 fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
They抎 never let me go. And you抎 end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Hi...
We抳e still got the Italian...
Shit! Fuck! What抯 fucking wrong with people!  I抦 going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
I saw the ad at George抯.  I抦 passing through town and I抦 in a hurry.
How much of a hurry are you in?
You抮e not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
What抯 this place? A hotel of some kind?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
You sure you passed on my message?
Have you heard of a French film called 揕a Collectionoose?
Oh... We split up.
I抳e got work tonight, Jane.
Hello there. How抯 the flat. I cleaned...
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it抯 there with...
Piss off!
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
What if it is?
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Problems?
Am I supposed to know him?
Clients come and go.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
The Hyatt...? What抯 that?
It抯 about the puppy. You got the money?
Your lady friend did.
Is she on the phone?
I can抰 think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What抯 your sister抯 number?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Fine...
Huh... I guess you ain抰 quite ready for civilisation yet... I抣l give you one more day, a meal, and then you抮e on your way.
Barstow抯 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you抮e heading, I reckon somebody抣l pick you up.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain抰 worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of 慹m.
What about which girlfriend?
Mon bureau co鹴ait trop cher.
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Okay, shitbag. I抦 only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Five seconds. Then you die.
You抮e the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see what抯 left of him...
I think you抎 rather not know what I think.
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
When they realise I抦 missing...
Moreau? C抏st moi. Alors...
They lost their son. Why?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become 慼ave-it- where-it抯-at?.. As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Very funny. Can I go on now?
What do you mean?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
And I would like to see a priest.
What did they say?
The king said you're his finest archer...?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
But that was her order!
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
Yes, but...
No, I... I held it up to...
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
W-w-what are you doing?!
God defeated the English, not me.
Who are you?
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
What were you doing when the voice came?
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
... and what... what did he say?
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
5,000 gold crowns.
Wait, wait...
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
Clear?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
Yeah...
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Prepare these as battering-rams!
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
Jeanne... what are you doing?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
They won't come anyway.
Why would they?
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
Who is this "he"?
Beautiful.
Only God knows the answer to that.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Sit.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Calm down, what, what is it?
Funny time to say this.
Henryk's in there.
Can you help us?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Mama, that was a great dinner.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
I can look after myself!
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Otherwise what?
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Pig!
How long have you been here?
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
I don't know how to thank you.
What about you?
Szpilman.
Watch your feet!
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
What's he say?
You'd have to organise it up here.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
What did she say?
She wants it to come.
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
How much did ya lose?
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
Then why ain't he dead?
There's always a depression on.
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
What's the problem?
See and raise five.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
What do you mean?
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
You should always look to the back too, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
What?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Oh!
Mother!
Did he tell you where he was going?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
You know, we know each other.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
Why... in the heart.
Where did you get this gun?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Who's is it?
What about the suicide?
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Are you kidding?
He telephoned me today.
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
About three.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
I couldn't go near that woman.
What are you going to do?
We're just having a little drink.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
I never had it.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
I'm not telling anyone.
But what if you need more money?
It might.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Perfectly absurd.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
Good. I want to talk to you.
No thanks.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Finished with these?
Did I give it to you?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
Sit down!
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
Back to California
What do you mean?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
I've got a lulu -- why?
The suspects!  They won't come.
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
You worked here?
You his wife?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Where were you going?
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
What?
What are we going to do!?
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
Not much of a pass.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
What about it?
Get off him.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
Give it to me!
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
At-at-at-at-at.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
Invest it.
She okay?
What?
It'd make their heads explode.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
What!?
What?
It's a mine, isn't it?
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
They're doing more than slapping.
Where the hell is it!?
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
What the hell took so long.
What if he's not?
No.
And you; you've got it all together.
What do you think our chances are?
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
Well?
An Iraqi?
To where?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Epps?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Australia.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
People are suffering.
He says it's a box.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
Iraqis.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
How long we going to keep this up.
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
Stress category.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
I'll try.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
What?
Not very encouraging.
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
We've lost SEN!
I don't know.
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
Remember this...?
No...no you're wrong.
Yes
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Who the heck're you?
What was-? Why...?
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
So what were they doing here?
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Which one's which?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Good, now the other side.
Keep talking.
More metal... sharp edge...
Yeah, another round thing.
Which one's which?
What... ?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
What do you think?
Computer device?
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Lane oil...
Alright!
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
What the hell was that?
You touch me again and--
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
What the hell's going on?
Vice... Jesus.
What was it this time?
Make an appointment.
P.E.T.N ...
Device.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
I'll do it.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
It's our only option.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
What did you talk about?
<u>Tonsili!</u>
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
No.
No.
Nice day, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
I would start with cocktails.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
You can trust me.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I hope you find the figures correct.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
The pepper, too?
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
And you--
That's too dark.
Do you know my first name?
Make it out to cash!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Oh? 
The same thing.
Madame.
I'll be delighted.
Yes, madame?
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
You look beautiful.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
It could have been marvelous ...
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Right!
Then why did you do it?
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
Holy shit.
The partners want to know how it's going?
There's a satellite call for you.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
She's not on the starboard side either.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
What could possible be funny?
You know I don't like that, Rose.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
My God... Cal. Is it a --
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Something serious has happened.
You're precious to me, Rose.
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
The boats are all going.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Where to, Miss?
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
April 14, 1912.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
I'm sorry.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
It's been 84 years...
Don't come any closer.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
It would be a nice change from you.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Hope we're not intruding.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
You'll excuse me. 
No-o!
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
How about a little game later?
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
I thought you were one of my friends.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
Isn't she attractive?
Thanks.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
What?--
I could see you were pining away--
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
Say--wait a minute!
Care to join us?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
How about you?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
What?
That's me!
Yes--Me--in person!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
I didn't--
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Well, he has a straw hat--
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
I went for four.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Not because of Ned.
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
Congratulations.
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Ain't got time.
God damn son of a...
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
So how's Tombstone treating you?
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Come on, you...
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
Very instructive
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
So what does he want?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Don't touch me!
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Just answer.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
What's wrong?
Wyatt!  My God...
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...
That thunder's sure somethin'.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
I just got it fixed.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
You'll never make that stick.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Virgil?
What about all these saloons?
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
I'm sure they will.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Yes -
Just - say it. Say it just once.
... Shoelaces?
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
That's reassuring.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Natalya?
Sidney Winch, meet -
... Kids?
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Bourbon. Neat.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Have we met?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
If I were you -
Why don't we just take these -
... Do you have a gun?
... How did you get into marine salvage?
What the hell does that do?
Down?
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
... And what do you call these?
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Sakwa!
Who's in charge here?
What's your name?
I was an attorney!
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
How is it now?
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
What is HE doing here?
He brought that up from the wreck.
How sweet.
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
Please sir. Please -
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
Why does he always pick on me?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Who is it?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I'm busy.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Harry, you know everything.
What's the problem here?
Good afternoon, ladies.
You invited me.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
None of your business.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
What must I do?
How are you?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Yeah!
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Yeah?!
Next stop...
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Hey!  Wow!
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Yes, I can.
Can!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
What's going on?
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Right?  Buddy?
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Hold on, Woody!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Great!
Ha-ha!!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
I dunno.
No she's NOT --
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
No!  No, no, no, no!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
They're getting bigger.
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
I got it, Woody!
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
W-w-w-we?
I'm red this time.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
I want to go home.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
You're only a young thing.
Who's there?
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
I'm Melanie.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
I... I don't really know.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
So my wife is lying?
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
About the other night, I'm sorry.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
Did you tell Dad?
Is this bad for him?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Private?
What's that mean?
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Yes, mom --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
I'll put this in the back.
You may speak.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
You should feel good about this.
One question.  How did you find about this?
What is the name of your informant?
My work keeps me young.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
What?
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Did you tell him?
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
Twenty thousand.
For fuck's sake.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Can I see you again?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
What happened?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Are you getting out much?
Following the game at all?
Good luck, Spud.
Exactly.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
You Only Live Twice?
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
You know.
Why?
No, I don't think so.
Excellent.
There.
Where did she come up with that?
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Homeless people?
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Sulu, what are you doing?
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Bob?
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Your pain runs deep.
Where did you get this power?
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
Jim.
Life is not a dream.
I could use a shower.
Not General Korrd.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Be one with the horse.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
There, you see? See?
How do you know?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
Spock... the booster rockets.
Spock.
...mark two.
What is this?
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
You are mad!
No special conditions?
What have I done?

Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
I know you better than that.
Sybok, we must find a way...
My dinner.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
How's it going upstairs?
Did he say why?
I want to go to his place.
Of what?
For what?
Flynn!
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Come on in...
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
This town's full o' live ones.
You said it.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
That was uncalled-for.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Alan!
Well, isn't it -- ?
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
A User -- in our world?
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Feel what? You okay?
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Thank. you, Master Control.
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
New guy...
What do you think?
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
Nice...
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
Dana, are you listening to me?
Dad, how come you know the words?
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Harry?  HARRY?!
What's this for?
Thanks dear.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
Now what?
I thought this look like your work.
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
Any minute now.
So, it was your first time.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Hello, Harry.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
That's fabulous Harry.
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
What did happen?
Not because you were attracted to him?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
And you agreed?
What?
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
I don't take those assignments.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
What is it?
As much as you used to?
What are you going to do?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Like one?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Did you read the papers yesterday?
Were they trying to kill you?					*
And you chased one?
You'll call me then?
What's happened?
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Who is this woman?
Did you get the letter?
Let me speak to Clarence.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
Sonny kicks ass.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
What are your turn-ons?
Turn-offs?
Wow. What a swell place to work.
How long have you worked here?
That's a long time.
Four hundred bucks.
God, Spiderman looks different.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
You know when you sat behind me?
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
You're a whore?
Is he black?
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Where you goin', honey?
Write down Drexl's address.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Naw naw!
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
If I thought I could get away with it -
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Who the fuck are you?
Wannabee nigger...
It's great to hear from you.
What?
Money problems?
That's a pretty amazing story.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
This shit can't be real.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Clarence...
Do you really mean it?
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
Where's everybody else?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Say it, goddamn it!
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Why does he trust you?
I'm really not very -
I really don't know.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
You and Robin moved?
Do you believe him?
Or a bit player -
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
Suspect's words -
We gotta get him outta there.
What was I sayin'?
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Preach on, Big D.
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
Just put it in your purse.
Do you live here?
Yes.
Women will want to get to know you...
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
To be determined by the proper authorities.
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
You're afraid of germs?
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
Mason???
We need gas.
See -- you can drive after all!
What made you think that?
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
You want me to rob him?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
You... you couldn't have heard me.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
Excuse me -- what did you say?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
JOSE!
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
Maybe I do.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
Where to?
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Will he be back soon?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
We ain't got no Beck's.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Let me get your change.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Jesus.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Where you headed?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What happens if you lose?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
All right, Grace.  No more games.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
How far is it to California?
Have you ever been there before?
Is it pretty?
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
John?  John where are you going?
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
If you want.
Let's go in the bedroom.
John . . .?
I shot him.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Well, nothing.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
John!
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
You've got to be--
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
You think that's a lot of money?
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
It's the truth, Jake.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Two-hundred dollars.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Christ, I don't believe this.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Nooo!
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
The old lady?
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.
Soda.  You got any soda?
No police.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Maybe I do.
Christ, I don't believe this!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
You've got to be--
California...
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
Next time you'll do just fine.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
Two-hundred.
Look, Harlin.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I like that about me, beautiful.
Thank you, Bobby.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Did you ever?
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Where?
What do you mean?
I wanted to talk.
Grace ... Grace?
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
So, aren't you going to ask me?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
I busted my leg!
Where ya goin'?
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
"Arkady"
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Out of here.
One way, or round trip?
Beck's.
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Let me get your change.
Son of a bitch!
Anybody hurt?
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
How old is Jeb?
I've come to a decision.
Megan?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
...I think rust.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
I'm not sure.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Just give me a minute.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
He's kind of a miracle.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
When?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
No Jeremy.
How much is it?
Don't be scared.
You like sports?
How are you feeling?
Where were you sitting on the train?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
You told them cowboys you had it.
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
He didn't say nothin', huh?
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Are you really going to kill them?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Oh. Yeah.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Heard you done the roof yourself.
What's all that wood?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Like I said, I...
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
About what?
Jesus!
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
It's gonna get riper yet.
Yup.
Did... you... get... him?
You could have it. All of it.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
She gave me the evil eye.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
HEY.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
Jesus.  You done this before?
I don't kill nobody without him. 
I don't get it.
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
They want more time to think about investing.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
I love you.
That's enough, Edie.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
I was out of line.
We'll make it.
Keaton, I can't just -
What if I
What about Redfoot?
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
He won't go into the interrogation room.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
So this lawyer...
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
What call?
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
How good's your intelligence?
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
We thought it was just.
What is the truth?
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
... he wants to testify ...?
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Orthopedics?
How is that?
How old are you?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
No further questions.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
That's not my handwriting.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
What is this going to cost?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
It's all right, Mickey.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
She getting good care over there?
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I didn't do too well for you.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
) I'm sorry ...?
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I need an extension for my case.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Nothing further, your Honor...
Continental Casualty...
Hello, I'm calling from...
D'you find an apartment?
Why?
I'm a lawyer.
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
Is this a bad time.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Is it over?
Thank you.
I have to talk to you.
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
...he's a good man...
...I have to stand up for her...
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
...four years ago...
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
... I understand ...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Kathy Price...
Yes.
What did she say?
I want to buy you a drink.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Yes.
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
And you like it.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Would you like a drink now?
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
I want you.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
My name is John Ferguson, and --
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
I told you! Right here!
Then will you for me?
Just dinner.
Mmm.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
Will you, Judy?
I like that one.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Ernie's?
Mmmm.
That's what I had in mind.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Can't you see?
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
When?
Oh... wandering about.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Where?
Where were you born?
No!... No!
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
What do you remember?
How do you know?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
Don't leave me... stay with me...
Go on.
Here with you.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Let me go into the church alone.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Step number two.
Easy, now.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Out. I've got things to do.
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Just wander.
Around.
Mm. Better.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Well...
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Can't do what?
How ya doing?
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
Why?
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Don't even start.
More.
Just stop.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
We'll be ready Adam.
Real times.
If anything ever happens to me...
I want you to hear me out.
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
What are you talking about?
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Yup.
That's right.
She's in there!
But not tonight.
What's your fucking point?
We need padded chairs.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Regarding what?
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
That's right.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
Your ideas never work out.
False.
Easy Micheal.
We're goosed.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
May we have the rings please?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
The wedding cake check?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Don't you dare.
How do you figure?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
Charles Moore for instants.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
You expect more what?
Time out.
Do you love me?
Seating problems.
Keith do not trivialize this.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
I need your help.
Will you please call the chair people?
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
The chairs.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
Don't even.
What?
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
That's just insecurity.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
I have no idea.
Where's Boyd?
Yeah?
"You Send Me."
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Don Amalio!
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Was that difficult to get?
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
Never.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Let me pass!
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
How much is that?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
It's very good.
Ramona! Ramona!
What's the matter with you?
You see how much you like her?
And this chest?
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
What are you doing here? Get out.
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
Don't say that.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
What happened to me?
How did you see me?
In English, please.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
Why would they be going there?
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty梖our citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
You need a maid.
How should I know?
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
It was you, wasn't it?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
SID 棗 NO!!!
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
John died.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better 棗 to improve upon what was already done.
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Give me your wrist.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Parker -?stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you棗
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
How did you find out about the toxin?
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Where the hell are you going?
How's your pulse?
Then shoot him already.
Where's John?
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
There you go 棗 best seat in the house.
Aren't you going to watch with me?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.

So what firm you with, pal?
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
I guess I'll head back...
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
What's that?
Anybody want another drink?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
She went to a waxwork party
Can I give her a message?
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
Tony and China?
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Sarah listen to me.
No thank you sir we're fine.
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Do you have a scarf?
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
I started seeing things.
I didn't want to come.
Fireball?
These are good.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
What?
Your friend saw them.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
What?
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Hello?
Tell me.  Please.
I wanted to apologize.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
What's your name?
You should have heard her play.
Jody--
You think he killed her?
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
But Claire--
Adamant?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
I don't know.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
Jody he was lying.
She's awake.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Whatcha reading?
How are you?
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
It's just us now.
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Remember how we were?
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
You didn't?
Sorry.  You understand.
I didn't do that.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
What are you doing?
You're not at the center.
There we go.
This is the Feur thing?
What?
You know I am.
We walked all night...
You don't remember?
Ow!
"You know..."
Claire, please don't...
We have to get out of here.
Adamant.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
A what...?
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Rowan.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
Who is this...?
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
Eighty million doll --- ?
What is it...?
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
uh - then he - be just -
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
STOP!
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
There is no one here but the dead.
If that were true, I would not be here.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
I do not understand...
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
Just one.  The bar's closed.
Harder...
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Stop it.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Rowan...?
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
You know...?
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Do you love me, Michael...?
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
You did that, didn't you...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
When aid you get home last night...?
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
He's got great hands.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
We'd better get to work on the papers.
OH MY GAWD!
I thought you were someone else
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
My names isn't ANGELA...
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
What didn't you like about her?
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
What?
What is it?
Where are you going?
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
Why did you let him in?
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Sugar?
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
And I was wondering.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
Sweetheart, what is it?
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
Son.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Who exactly ARE you?
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
Well?
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
My legacy.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
James, what are you doing here?
My new bike.
If you could just sign right there.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
I don't get the distinction.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Don't write that part.
Well? What do you think of her?
Wow...you clean up nice.
It's all so complicated.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
What about you?
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
I do?
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
You look pretty.
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
How soon can we get something?
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
You okay?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
I don't know what to say...
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Will you do me one favor?
At that point were you able to fight him off?
I want a full-scale investigation.
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
The teeth, were they...
What did you do then?
Ms. Toller?
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Is there some reason why you're here?
Excuse me?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
How much?
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
I'm here.
I don't know.  I want to see you...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Say you love me.
I'm running away.
Forget it.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
Come on, let loose!
Where is she?
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Sam, for godsake.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
J. S. Bach.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
That's a lot of butler.
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
What was all that back there?
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Thank you.
This is good.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
It is?
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
When we find him, he is mine.
It was in your book.
My hat is off to you, sir.
God in heaven, what is that?!
My God!  He's so excessive!
He's not giving up?
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
She's perfectly safe.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Your private train, sir.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
I beg your pardon?
Well?
Hey...!
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
You left me to die, friend.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I can't.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Sorsha.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
You gotta promise to feed her.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
Madmartigan, I need your help.
She's a bird, Willow.
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
What do you want!
Kill him!
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Time is running out.
She needs to be changed.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
She's hungry.
Ohhh, I hate this.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
Everything is all right, John.
I saw him.
Is it them?
Amish.
What have you got?
You know who?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
Who else knows?
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Whacking?
But not a good tired.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
But why?
How long?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
But Stoltzfus said...
Won him over just like that.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
I'm coming.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him ?
God, Fred...
No? Why not?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws ?
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
I am not a child.
I will be the judge of that.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
She say where he is?
No, you listen. Get out!
Is this where we're going?
I wish dawdie was with us.
Yes.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
From now on you'll be history
Our echo.
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Uhhhh -- yes...
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
...Toto, too?
Oh, now?
Oh --
Oh --
Oh -- 
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Oh, my!
...has been simply unbearable.
A home --
Yes -- let's run!
Who's her?  Who's her?
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
How about a hippopotamus?
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd sooner wait outside.
Because I'm still scared!
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Did I scare you?
Um-hmm.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
He said his mouth.
...along.
Yes -- there --
Here --   Come on.
I've got a plan how to get in there.
And you're going to lead us.
It's a whatzis.
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
You don't get around us that easy!
... about Dorothy.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Come on -- come on --
...to Dorothy!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
How can I ever thank you enough?
Stop that dog!
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
The plutonium is missing.  They抳e taken the core!
Who抯 she?
Nuclear.
The King pipeline.
I抦 well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra抯 ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn抰 completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don抰 want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I抦 not sure he knew that.
You don抰 take no for an answer, do you?
I can抰 stay here.
What is it?
Vodka martini.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat抯 nest.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
Really Bond, couldn抰 you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
What is this place?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn抰 think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they抮e coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
This is the end.
Everything抯 under control up here.  Are you ready?
We抳e been pawns in someone抯 game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
The parcel抯 in the post.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Walter --
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
What's your theory?
Blake?  Dead?
I could stay and go.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Jon, where are we?
Jon --
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
No.  I just wanted you to --
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
Laurie --
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
. . . That was quick.
What new information?
What happened?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Their real names, please.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
New information.
Who the hell are you?
What is this place?
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
What do I get out of it?
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
But programmable. And expendable.
Whatchu doing here?
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
You do everything Yorgi says?
I was invited. What's your story?
Go to hell!
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
What are you doing?
Nothing. He had two days.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
This is your standard dart gun.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
Sit down.
Dude, what are you doing here?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
What does that mean?
I wish I could go.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
Jean... can you?
He's uptight.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Dr. Grey.
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Come with me and I'll let her live.
What are you going to do?
The point of what?
Don't you knock?
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
I lost him.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Is that so?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
Oh, shit.
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Still happy you married me?
You have your tickets?
I hope you like large weddings.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Surprised?
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I suppose you're right.
There seem to be quite a few books.
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
How long will this whole thing take?
I didn't do that.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
Vermicelli.
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
What are you doing here?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
What a filthy job!
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
Throw the second switch!
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
No, no!  That whole thing!
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
All right -- where is she?
What monster?
Come on, big fellow!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
Get the sedative ready!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
MMMmmmmmm.
Extremely well.
Inga!
Ooh!
Look, Doctor!
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
Reputation.  Reputation!
What are you going to do?
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Just passing through the night.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
What?
Yes, I have mine.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Yes, sir, name, please?
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
